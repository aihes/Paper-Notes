A minimalist and modern diagram comparing 'AI Agent' and 'Agentic AI'.

- **Left side (AI Agent):** A single, sleek robot icon holding multiple tools (API icon, database icon, search icon). The robot is facing a linear checklist of tasks. Title: 'AI Agent: Task Executor'.
- **Right side (Agentic AI):** A group of several smaller, specialized robot icons (e.g., one with a lightbulb for planning, one with a magnifying glass for analysis) collaborating around a circular table. In the center of the table is a complex, interconnected mind map or blueprint. Title: 'Agentic AI: Collaborative Ecosystem'.
- **Overall Style:** Use a clean, flat design with a cool color palette (blues, purples, grays). The two sides should be clearly separated by a vertical line. The overall title should be 'AI Agent vs. Agentic AI'.
