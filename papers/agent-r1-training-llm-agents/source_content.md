Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building
Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve com-
plex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with
significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of
RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges.
Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specif-
ically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and
easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance
this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodolo-
gies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM
Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly
training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adap-
tation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted
experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the
effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Introduction
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding and generation [2, 4], and are increasingly being applied to more complex
intelligent tasks[24]. When LLMs are assigned an “agent” role, they are expected not only to
perform cognitive tasks such as reasoning and decision-making, but also to act autonomously, learn
continuously, and adapt to changes within interactive environments [35, 25, 16]. Unlike traditional
static reasoning tasks[30], LLMs functioning as agents must maintain memory across multiple
dialogue rounds[37], exhibit sequential decision-making capabilities, and respond effectively to
environmental feedback—bringing them closer to real-world autonomous intelligent systems [27, 13].
This direction opens new possibilities for building general artificial intelligence with self-evolving
and problem-solving capabilities[31, 9].
While Reinforcement Learning (RL)[5, 26, 6] has demonstrated notable success in enhancing LLM ca-
pabilities for relatively well-defined tasks such as mathematical problem solving and code generation
[15, 19, 1], its application to developing LLMs as autonomous, interactive agents is comparatively
nascent. Agent settings inherently require models to make sequential decisions, maintain memory
across turns, and adapt to stochastic environmental feedback [35, 27], presenting unique challenges
distinct from more static tasks[16, 30]. This leads to specific difficulties when applying RL; partic-
ularly in multi-turn interaction scenarios, agent training can encounter instability, complex reward

signal design, and limited generalization [3, 10, 20]. Thus, there remains a need for a more detailed
exploration of how RL methodologies can be systematically applied and adapted to LLM agents,
alongside a need for flexible and scalable training frameworks [14, 18].
To systematically address these aspects, this paper presents contributions from both a conceptual
and practical standpoint. Conceptually, we focus on clarifying the application of Reinforcement
Learning to LLM Agents. We achieve this by extending the standard Markov Decision Process (MDP)
framework[22], providing a detailed account of how its core components—State Space, Action Space,
State Transition Probability, and Reward Function—can be adapted to comprehensively model the
multi-turn, interactive nature of LLM Agents [7, 36]. Building upon this adapted MDP formulation,
we further elaborate on mechanisms for optimizing agent policy from multi-turn trajectories[17],
emphasizing the importance of distinguishing agent-generated actions from environmental feedback
and incorporating intermediate (process) rewards [11, 27] to guide learning effectively. In addition,
to facilitate the practical application of these concepts, we develop Agent-R1, a flexible and user-
friendly training platform for RL-based LLM Agents. Thanks to its modular architecture, Agent-R1
supports rapid integration of various environment interfaces and task scenarios, and can dynamically
adapt to different computational resource requirements, enabling easy scalability to complex and
diverse applications [32, 12].
Through systematic experiments on the challenging task of multi-hop question answering (Multi-hop
QA), we validate the effectiveness of our approach and framework[16, 33]. This task focuses on
complex reasoning involving cross-document logical chaining and information retrieval, imposing
high demands on the agent’s multi-step decision-making ability, adaptability to environmental
feedback, and knowledge construction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
and framework can enhance the model’s performance in such dynamic interactive environments[29].

From Large Language Models to Agents: An MDP Perspective
The sequential decision-making processes inherent in Large Language Model (LLM) applications
can be effectively formulated within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, whether for
simple text generation or for the complex interactions of LLM Agents. However, evolving the
MDP formulation from its application to LLMs in the context of static, single-turn text generation
tasks (such as in mathematics or code generation), to one suitable for LLM Agents that engage
in inherently dynamic, multi-turn, and richly interactive environmental dialogues, necessitates
substantial extensions. This section delineates these critical differences by contrasting the core MDP
components for a Static LLM versus a LLM Agent.

LLM Agent, highlighting the necessary extensions for interactive, multi-turn scenarios.
MDP Component
Static LLM
LLM Agent
State Space (S)
The state st primarily encapsu-
lates the current textual context,
including the initial prompt and
the sequence of tokens generated
so far. Its focus is on predicting
the next coherent token.
st
=
(wp, w1, ..., wt).
The state st is significantly more
comprehensive, retaining the his-
tory of multi-turn interactions and
environmental feedback. This en-
ables decisions informed by a full
dialogue history.
Each Ti repre-
sents a full turn of agent action
and environment feedback. st =
(wp, T1, ..., Tk, T partial
k+1 ).
Action Space (A)
The action at corresponds to select-
ing the next token wt+1 from the
LLM’s vocabulary V.
The fundamental action is also to-
ken generation from V. However,
specific token sequences can be in-
terpreted as commands to invoke ex-
ternal tools, enabling active environ-
mental intervention.
State Transition (P)
State transitions are determinis-
tic.
The next state is uniquely
determined by appending the se-
lected token to the current sequence.
P(st+1|st, at) = 1 if st+1 = st ⊕
at.
The state transition mechanism in-
corporates environmental interac-
tion, which can be stochastic. It
distinguishes between deterministic
generative transitions (PG) and po-
tentially stochastic environmental
transitions (PE) triggered by tool
use.
Reward Function (R)
Rewards are typically sparse and
provided at the end of a complete
generation, evaluating the overall
quality of the final output.
The reward structure is richer and
more dense. In addition to a final
outcome reward (rf), agents can re-
ceive intermediate process rewards
(rp) for successfully executing steps
like tool invocation, providing more
frequent feedback.
2.1
State Space (S)
Static LLM: In single-turn text generation, the state st primarily encapsulates the current tex-
tual context. This includes the initial prompt wp and the sequence of tokens generated thus far
w1, w2, . . . , wt:
st = (wp, w1, w2, . . . , wt).
(1)
The state space is focused on capturing the information necessary to predict the next token in a
coherent sequence.
LLM Agent: For an Agent engaging in multi-turn interactions, the state st must be significantly
more comprehensive. It needs to retain not only the textual context but also the history of interactions
and environmental feedback. The state is thus extended to:
st = (wp, T1, T2, . . . , Tk, T partial
k+1 ).
(2)
Here, each Ti represents a complete interaction turn, comprising the Agent’s generated tokens
(wi1, . . . , wiTi) and the subsequent environmental feedback wei, i.e., Ti = (wi1, . . . , wiTi, wei).
The term T partial
k+1
denotes the partially generated sequence in the current, ongoing turn. This enriched
state representation enables the Agent to make decisions informed by a comprehensive history of
dialogue and environmental outcomes (e.g., results from tool utilization).

quence.

tion as commands to invoke external

Reward (R)

the end of the generation.
Receives dense process rewards for
intermediate steps in addition to a
final reward.
2.2
Action Space (A)
Static LLM: The action at corresponds to the selection of the next token wt+1 from the LLM’s
vocabulary V. The action space A(st) is typically the set V.
LLM Agent: Similarly, an Agent’s action at is the selection of the next token from V. However,
the implication of an action sequence can be broader. Specific sequences of tokens generated by
the Agent might be interpreted as commands to invoke external tools or APIs. Thus, while the
fundamental action remains token generation, its functional outcome can extend beyond mere text
production to active environmental intervention.
2.3
State Transition Probability (P)
Static LLM: State transitions in LLM text generation are deterministic. Given the current state st
and an action at (selecting token wt+1), the next state st+1 is uniquely determined by appending
wt+1 to the current sequence:
P(st+1|st, at) =
1,
if st+1 = st ⊕at
0,
otherwise
,
(3)
where ⊕denotes sequence concatenation.
LLM Agent: The state transition mechanism for Agents introduces a crucial distinction by incorpo-
rating environmental interaction, which can be stochastic. Transitions can be categorized based on
whether an action instigates such interaction:
P(st+1|st, at) =
PE(st+1|st, at),
if at triggers tool/environment interaction
PG(st+1|st, at),
otherwise (standard token generation)
,
(4)
While PG (generative transition) mirrors the deterministic nature of Static LLM token generation
(PG(st+1|st, at) = 1 if st+1 = st ⊕at, and 0 otherwise), PE (environmental transition) reflects the
uncertainty inherent in tool execution and environmental responses. The next state st+1 then depends
not only on the Agent’s action but also on the outcome from the external environment (e.g., an API
response, result of a computation), which forms part of the environmental feedback wei.
2.4
Reward Function (R)
Static LLM: Rewards are typically sparse and provided at the end of a complete generation sequence,
i.e., upon reaching a terminal state sT . This is often a result-based reward, R(sT ), evaluating the
overall quality (e.g., coherence, relevance) of the generated text.

Figure 2: Illustration of the Agent-R1 training trajectory. The agent performs multi-turn reasoning
and tool-based actions during rollout, receives environment feedback, and appends tool responses to
form the next state. This trajectory—containing thinking steps, actions, and feedback—serves as the
basis for reinforcement learning updates in Agent-R1.
LLM Agent: The reward structure for Agents is often richer and more dense, accommodating the
multi-turn nature of their tasks. The reward R(st, at, st+1) can be defined as:
R(st, at, st+1) =



rf(st+1),
if st+1 is a terminal state
rp(st, at, st+1),
if at triggers a significant intermediate event
0,
otherwise (e.g., during routine token generation)
.
(5)
Here, rf(st+1) is the final outcome reward for task completion. Crucially, Agents can also receive
process rewards, rp(st, at, st+1), for successfully executing intermediate steps, such as effective
tool invocation or making tangible progress towards a goal. These intermediate signals provide more
frequent feedback, guiding the learning process more effectively.
In summary, adapting the MDP framework from Static LLMs to LLM Agents involves significant
enhancements across the core components discussed. The state space expands to incorporate in-
teraction history and environmental feedback; actions, while fundamentally token generation, can
trigger external effects; state transitions integrate environmental stochasticity; and the reward system
becomes more granular with the inclusion of process rewards. These extensions are crucial for en-
abling reinforcement learning algorithms to train sophisticated Agents capable of complex, multi-step
reasoning and interaction within dynamic environments.

Agent-R1 Framework
To better accommodate the reinforcement learning requirements of LLM Agents, we introduce
Agent-R1, a flexible and highly extensible agent reinforcement learning training framework as
shown in Figure 2. Drawing from existing efficient reinforcement learning infrastructures, we extend
traditional single-turn reinforcement learning training frameworks to fully adapt to the multi-turn
interactive characteristics of agents, enabling seamless integration with diverse task environments
and scalable training across increasingly complex agent settings. Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate the
workflow comparison between traditional single-turn reinforcement learning training frameworks
and Agent-R1’s multi-turn reinforcement learning training, where Figure 3 shows the generation
stage and Figure 4 shows the learning stage. The most significant difference between single-turn and
multi-turn reinforcement learning lies in the rollout phase: single-turn rollout processes only require
the Actor Model to generate responses once, while multi-turn rollout involves multiple complex
interactions. To achieve flexible and easily extensible multi-turn rollout, we have carefully designed
two core modules: Tool and ToolEnv.
3.1
Tool and ToolEnv: Core Modules for Interactive Rollout
The interactive rollout process, central to training LLM Agents, relies heavily on two key components:
Tool and ToolEnv. A clear division of responsibilities between these modules is fundamental to the
Agent-R1 design philosophy.
5
Figure 3: Flow diagram of Single-Turn RL and Multi-Turn RL(Agent-R1) in generation stage.
Figure 4: Flow diagram of Single-Turn RL and Multi-Turn RL(Agent-R1) in learning stage.
The Tool is conceived as an executor of specific, atomic actions. Its primary role is to encapsulate
a distinct capability—such as calling an external API, executing a piece of code, or accessing a
database. When invoked, a Tool performs its action and returns the direct, raw outcome of that action.
It essentially reports “what happened" factually.
Conversely, the ToolEnv acts as the orchestrator and interpreter within the reinforcement learning
(RL) environment. It takes the raw output from a Tool and determines how that output affects the
Agent’s perceived state and the overall task progression. ToolEnv is responsible for managing the
state transitions within the RL loop, calculating appropriate reward signals based on these transitions
and tool outcomes, and packaging the new state information for the agent. It dictates “what this
outcome means for the agent and the task."
3.1.1
Tool Design
Tools serve as the critical interface connecting agents to external environments or functionalities. In
the Agent-R1 framework, we utilize Tools as the unified interface for agent-environment interaction,
where all external functionalities are encapsulated into standardized, directly callable "tools" by the
agent. Drawing inspiration from OpenAI’s Function Calling paradigm, the Agent-R1 framework
provides high-level abstraction and standardization of Tools through the BaseTool abstract base class.
Its design focuses on two core modules:
Core Execution Logic:
As the most critical abstract method within the BaseTool class, all concrete
tool subclasses must implement the execution method. This method encapsulates the core logic of the
tool, defining how it processes input parameters, performs its specific operation (such as interacting
with an external API, executing code, or accessing a database), and returns a structured result.
6
Tool Metadata Specification:
To ensure the standardization and parsability of tool invocation, the
following metadata attributes are defined:
• Identification and Description: The name attribute (a unique string identifier) and the
description attribute (providing detailed information about the tool’s functionality, use cases,
and expected effects) work synergistically. Agents understand these to identify and select
appropriate tools based on the current context.
• Parameter Structure Definition: The parameters attribute follows JSON Schema specifi-
cations to define the input parameter structure required for tool invocation. This includes
parameter names, data types, detailed descriptions, and whether they are required. The
standardization of parameters ensures agents can generate tool invocation parameters that
conform to expected formats.
This design, centered on the execute method’s pivotal role in performing actions and the clear metadata
specifications that enable agent understanding, allows LLM agents to effectively interact with external
environments via structured interfaces. The outcomes of tool execution are then processed by the
ToolEnv module, which is responsible for managing the corresponding environmental state transitions.
This interplay is fundamental for agents to solve complex problems in multi-turn interactions and
forms a cohesive link with ToolEnv’s state management design.
3.1.2
ToolEnv Design
The ToolEnv module acts as the dynamic environment within the Agent-R1 reinforcement learning
framework. It is responsible for managing the agent’s interaction with the world, particularly
when tools are involved. This module implements the two core functionalities required of an
RL environment: state transition and reward calculation, especially in the context of multi-turn
interactions and non-deterministic outcomes from tool use. The design is formalized through the
BaseToolEnv abstract base class.
Core State Transition and Reward Logic:
The most critical abstract method is step. This
method is the primary engine for environmental interaction: it receives the agent’s raw output
(e.g., generated text potentially containing tool calls) and processes this output to identify and
orchestrate tool invocations in coordination with the Tool module. Based on the agent’s actions and
any feedback from tool execution, step then updates the environment’s internal state. It also calculates
an appropriate reward signal reflecting the outcome of the action and the new state. Finally, it returns
the new state, the reward, and other relevant information (such as success status and activity flags) to
the agent. This method encapsulates the logic for both standard generative state transitions and the
more complex, potentially stochastic transitions resulting from tool interactions.
Supporting Mechanisms for Interaction Management:
To facilitate the step method’s compre-
hensive role and manage the nuances of tool-based interactions, several key auxiliary methods are
defined within BaseToolEnv. The process_responses_ids method provides customizable logic for
identifying tool call triggers within the raw token ID sequences generated by the LLM, determining
the precise point of invocation. Subsequently, extract_tool_calls is responsible for parsing these raw
LLM responses to identify and structure intended tool invocation requests, including the tool’s name
and its parameters. Following a tool’s execution, format_tool_response converts the raw results (ob-
tained from Tool.execute) into a string format suitable for presentation to the LLM as part of the new
environmental state. Complementing these, the stop method implements the logic for determining
trajectory termination conditions, assessing whether the current interaction should end based on LLM
output, task completion, error states, or predefined limits.
This design, centered on the step method’s pivotal role in driving environmental dynamics and
supported by clear mechanisms for managing tool calls and trajectory lifecycle, enables the Agent-R1
framework to effectively simulate complex interactive scenarios. It carefully distinguishes between
deterministic text generation and the non-deterministic, environment-altering state changes introduced
by tool use, which are crucial for agent learning.

3.2
Optimizing Agent Policy from Multi-Turn Trajectories
After the rollout phase, we have obtained comprehensive multi-turn interaction trajectories. Each
trajectory contains the sequence of states, the agent’s actions (generated text portions), and the reward
signals. As noted, the environment provides reward signals for each interaction turn, which are termed
process rewards (rp), in addition to a potential final outcome reward (rf). To clearly delineate
the tokens generated by the LLM agent (its actions) from the environmental feedback or the initial
prompt within the trajectory, we introduce an Action Mask. This mask identifies precisely which
parts of the sequence correspond to the agent’s learnable actions.
Reinforcement learning optimizes the policy model’s actions to maximize expected cumulative re-
wards. The Agent-R1 framework leverages the detailed information from these multi-turn trajectories,
including the action masks and process rewards, to achieve this during its learning stage (as illustrated
in Figure 4). Key aspects of how this information is utilized include:
Refined and Aligned Advantage Calculation
As seen in the generation stage (Figure 3), the
“Advantages” are no longer solely based on the final outcome reward and value estimates from
the Critic Model. The “Process Rewards” gathered from ToolEnv during the rollout are explicitly
incorporated. This means the advantage ˆAt at each relevant step t within a trajectory reflects not
only future discounted rewards (derived from outcome rewards and value function estimates) but also
the immediate success of intermediate steps, such as effective tool invocation (captured by process
rewards). The “Advantages” block in Figure 3 shows it taking input from “Values” (Critic Model),
“Outcome Reward” (Reward Model), and “Process Rewards”. Crucially, the calculation of these
advantages ˆAt (e.g., using Generalized Advantage Estimation - GAE) is performed such that they are
aligned with the agent’s actions as identified by the Action Mask. While rewards accrue based on
state transitions and value functions estimate state goodness, the final advantages used for updating
the policy are pertinent to the specific timesteps where the agent generated an action. This ensures
that credit (positive or negative advantage) is assigned to the actual decisions made by the agent,
rather than to parts of the sequence it did not control, such as prompt tokens or fixed environmental
responses. These action-aligned advantages are then passed to the learning stage (Figure 4).
Masked Policy Optimization (Actor Loss)
In the learning stage (Figure 4), the Actor Model (pol-
icy) is updated to increase the probability of actions that lead to higher advantages. The “Trajectory”
data is fed into the Actor Model to produce “New Action Logits”. The Action Mask plays a crucial
role here. When calculating the Actor Loss (often a policy gradient loss like PPO’s clipped surrogate
objective), the mask ensures that the loss is computed only over the tokens generated by the agent.
The “Ratio” between the new policy’s action probabilities and the old policy’s action probabilities
(derived from “New Action Logits” and “Action Logits” from the generation phase, respectively) is
modulated by these aligned advantages, and this calculation is guided by the Action Mask.
Value Function Update (Critic Loss)
The Critic Model is trained to more accurately estimate the
expected cumulative reward (value) from different states. Using the “Trajectory” data, it generates
“New Values”. The Critic Loss is typically a mean squared error between these “New Values” and
the observed returns (which include both process and outcome rewards) from the trajectory, or the
target values derived from these returns and existing value estimates (e.g., in TD learning). This helps
the critic provide better baseline estimates for advantage calculation in subsequent iterations.
By ensuring that the “Advantages” are calculated in alignment with the agent’s actual actions (and
subsequently used with the “Action Mask” during policy optimization), Agent-R1 provides a more
precise and effective learning signal. This detailed feedback mechanism allows the Actor and Critic
models to learn more efficiently from complex, extended dialogues and tool-use scenarios, driving
the agent towards mastering sophisticated tasks.

Empirical Study
We empirically evaluate Agent-R1’s efficacy and design contributions in a challenging multi-hop
question answering scenario where LLMs use external search. This study first validates the frame-
work’s effectiveness in training LLM agents with various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms
for multi-turn interactive tasks. Second, an ablation analysis investigates the impact of key policy

optimization refinements: the action mask for loss computation (“loss mask”) and for aligning
advantages (“advantage mask”). The overarching goal is to assess the LLM’s learned ability for tool
invocation and information retrieval, highlighting Agent-R1’s utility.

Tasks and Datasets
Our study uses Multi-hop Question Answering (MultihopQA) datasets. The
training set comprises 51,200 samples, equally and randomly drawn from the HotpotQA[34] and
2WikiMultihopQA[8] training splits. We evaluate on the full development sets of HotpotQA and
2WikiMultihopQA (in-domain) and Musique[28] (out-of-domain), which require multi-step retrieval
and reasoning.
Models and Tools
Experiments use Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct [23] within the NousToolEnv using its
native function calling. The agent employs a single wikisearch tool querying a KILT Wikipedia
corpus ( 36M passages [21], embeddings by bge-large-en-v1.5), returning top 5 documents.

A sparse final outcome reward rf is used, defined as:
rf =

Here, ranswer = EM(apred, agold) is the Exact Match score. The formatting score, rformat = (rformata +
rformatt)/2, averages binary indicators for correct final answer presentation (rformata) and valid tool
call syntax (rformatt). This structure strictly rewards perfectly formatted, correct answers and penalizes
any formatting errors.

Main Results
The primary results of our framework validation, evaluating the performance of various Reinforcement
Learning (RL) algorithms supported by Agent-R1 against baseline methods, are presented in Table 3.
The experiments were conducted on three multi-hop question answering datasets. HotpotQA and
2WikiMultihopQA (2Wiki) served as in-domain datasets, while Musique was used as an out-of-
domain dataset. The reported scores are Exact Match (EM) values, representing the primary metric
for task success.

Table 3 clearly demonstrates that all RL-trained agents substantially outperform both the Base
Tool Call (0.0847) and Naive RAG (0.1328) baselines. For instance, the weakest RL agent (RE-
INFORCE++, average EM 0.3300) still surpassed RAG by a factor of approximately 2.5. This
significant margin highlights the crucial role of RL in training proficient LLM agents capable of
9
complex multi-turn decision-making and effective tool use, moving beyond simpler heuristic or
single-pass methods.
Among the RL methods, GRPO (average EM 0.3877) exhibited the best overall performance,
closely followed by PPO (0.3719) and RLOO (0.3716). PPO notably excelled on the challenging
out-of-domain Musique dataset. While REINFORCE++ (0.3300) was the weakest RL performer,
incorporating a baseline in REINFORCE++Baseline (0.3619) provided a clear benefit, though it did
not match the top-tier algorithms. These results robustly validate Agent-R1’s efficacy in training
powerful LLM agents via end-to-end RL, showing consistent, substantial gains over baselines across
diverse datasets and RL algorithms. This affirms the value of our framework for optimizing agent
policies in interactive settings.

Ablation Study on Policy Optimization Refinements
To investigate the significance of specific policy optimization refinements within the Agent-R1
framework—namely, the use of an action mask for loss computation (termed “loss mask”) and for
the alignment of advantages (termed “advantage mask”)—we conducted an ablation study. This
study utilized the PPO and GRPO algorithms. The results, in terms of Exact Match (EM) scores, are
presented in Table 4, where each ablation step is shown relative to the configuration in the preceding

The ablation experiments (Table 4) underscore the critical roles of both the loss mask and the
advantage mask. Disabling the loss mask consistently degrades performance for both PPO (e.g.,
average EM dropping from 0.3136 to 0.3022 when removed from a PPO variant with the advantage
mask already disabled) and GRPO (average EM dropping from 0.3877 to 0.3722). This highlights
its necessity in focusing gradients on agent-generated tokens. Similarly, for PPO, disabling the
advantage mask (while the loss mask is active, comparing the first two PPO rows) causes a
substantial performance drop from an average EM of 0.3719 to 0.3136, affirming the importance of
accurate credit assignment. These findings validate that these masking strategies are crucial design
choices within Agent-R1 for effective policy optimization in interactive LLM agents.

Conclusion
This work clarifies how Reinforcement Learning can be effectively applied to LLM Agents by
extending the classical MDP framework to capture multi-turn interaction, environmental feedback,
and process rewards. Based on these insights, we introduced Agent-R1, a modular and extensible
framework that supports multi-turn rollouts, precise credit assignment, and flexible integration of
tools and environments. Experiments on multi-hop question answering demonstrate that Agent-R1
enables LLM agents to achieve substantial improvements over baseline methods, and ablation results
confirm the importance of its key policy optimization components. We hope Agent-R1 provides a
foundation for future work on scalable and unified RL training for agentic LLMs.
