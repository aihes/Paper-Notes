Abstract
Modern LLMs are trained to “think” primarily via explicit text generation, such as chain-of-thought
(CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. We present
and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped
Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through
(i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth
allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance
that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through
controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but
from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of
LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Introduction
The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has historically relied on scaling up model size as
the primary driver, accompanied by increases in data and compute [1–4]. However, deploying models with
hundreds of billions of parameters requires extensive infrastructure, increasing latency and cost while limiting
accessibility. These factors make parameter efficiency critical: achieving better model capability within a
fixed parameter budget. Such models not only mitigate overfitting on finite datasets with fewer trainable
parameters, but also enable more practical deployment with lighter infrastructure. To achieve such parameter
efficiency, two main avenues have been explored. The first expands the training corpus regardless of model
size [5], though data scarcity increasingly limits this path. The second leverages inference-time compute
through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [6], allowing models to spend more compute on complex problems
via extended token generation.
We explore a third pathway based on architectural innovation: achieving dynamic computation within a
fixed parameter budget. This is accomplished by recursively applying shared parameters, where a group of
weight-tied layers are iteratively reused during the forward pass. We call this the Looped Language Model
(LoopLM). The design yields several advantages. First, LoopLM enables adaptive computation via a learned
early-exit mechanism: simple inputs can terminate after fewer recurrent steps, while complex ones allocate
more iterations. This decouples the compute depth from parameter count. Second, unlike inference-time
methods such as CoT, LoopLM scales by deepening its internal computational graph rather than extending
the output sequence, avoiding context-length bloat. Finally, LoopLM can improve capacity per parameter
and outperform standard transformers of larger sizes when trained on the same data.
An extensive range of prior studies have explored LoopLM at modest scales [7–14], from the seminal Universal
Transformer [15] to recursive Transformers [16] and latent reasoning approaches [17–19]. Yet whether Looped
Language Models translate into frontier-level gains at practically meaningful scales is unproven. To this end,
we ask:
Does LoopLM exhibit more favorable scaling behavior (loss, efficiency, safety, capability growth),
compared to non-recursive transformer models?
We show the answer is yes. We characterize LoopLM’s scaling trajectory and saturation behavior, demon-
strating that LoopLM offers a more efficient path to higher performance. These claims are evaluated under
multi-trillion-token training regimes typical of SoTA foundation models, extending well beyond prior work.
Beyond the empirical gains, we analyze the mechanisms behind these improvements by asking the following
questions:
1. Does the recursive reuse of weights yield the capability gains typically obtained by increasing depth
with unshared weights?
2. Are LoopLM’s gains monotonic in the number of loops? What are the factors that influence this?
Our Contribution
We address the above questions with a multi-faceted study. We scale LoopLM pre-training to 7.7T tokens and
thoroughly investigate its scaling behavior across multiple axes. To enable adaptive computation, we introduce
training objectives that enable computationally efficient recurrence while preserving peak performance. We
also run controlled ablations to isolate the sources of LoopLM’s gains. Specifically, our contributions are:
• Exceptional parameter efficiency at scale. By pre-training on 7.7T tokens, we demonstrate that 1.4B
and 2.6B parameter LoopLMs match 4B and 8B standard transformers on most benchmarks, yielding
2-3× parameter-efficiency gains that are critical for deployment in resource constrained environments
(Figure 1 and Figure 2).
• Entropy-regularized adaptive computation. Adaptive exits tend to collapse to shallow depths or overuse
long loops. We avoid this with entropy-reguarization under a uniform prior over exit steps for unbiased
depth exploration, followed by a focused training stage that tunes the compute-performance trade-off
and allocates steps based on input difficulty.

• Mechanistic understanding of recurrence. Using controlled experiments inspired by the physics-of-LMs
framework, we find recurrence does not increase raw knowledge storage (approximately 2 bits per
parameter for looped and non-looped models) but dramatically enhances knowledge manipulation
capabilities on tasks requiring fact composition and multi-hop reasoning.
• Improved safety and faithfulness. LoopLM reduces harmfulness on HEx-PHI [20], with safety improving
as recurrent steps increase (including extrapolated steps). Compared to CoT, our iterative latent updates
produce reasoning traces that are better aligned with final outputs, indicating greater causal faithfulness
rather than post-hoc rationalization.
Our study establishes loop depth as a third scaling axis beyond model size and data, and we publicly release
the Ouro model family (1.4B and 2.6B parameters) to demonstrate the benefits of LoopLM at scale.

Related Works
The core ideas of this architecture have resurfaced in recent literature, with recurrent-depth structures used
to improve the efficiency and reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. For example, Geiping et al. [17] adopts
a “recurrent depth” to scale test-time computation in latent space. Similarly, Saunshi et al. [7] demonstrates
that “looped transformers” can match the performance of much deeper non-looped models on reasoning tasks,
formally connecting looping to the generation of latent thoughts. The approach is refined by converting
standard models into “Relaxed Recursive Transformers” with a common base block while injecting unique
LoRA adapters across recursive steps [16]. Similar concepts have emerged under different terms, such as
“pondering” in continuous space [? ] and “inner thinking” for adaptive computation [21]. More advanced
variants, such as Mixture-of-Recursions [22] combine recursive parameter efficiency with adaptive, token-level
routing.
Across all these works, from the original Universal Transformer to its modern descendants, this emerging line
of architectures can be understood in two complementary ways. From one perspective, it behaves like a deep

Transformer where the weights of all layers are tied. From another, iteration functions as latent reasoning,
where the hidden states form a latent chain of thought that progressively refines the representation to solve
a task. Taken together, these results suggest that models can improve their ability to reason by reusing
computation internally without having to increase parameter count, shifting scale to substance.
Perspective 1: Parameter Sharing for Model Efficiency.
This view treats LoopLM as parameter
sharing: one or more Transformer blocks, or even submodules (e.g., attention, FFN), are reused across the
depth of the model, reducing parameters without changing the computation. The most prominent example in
the modern transformer era is ALBERT [23], which combines parameter re-use with embedding factorization
to drastically reduce the total parameter count. Prior to the widespread adoption of LLMs, parameter sharing
was explored extensively in machine translation [24]; Takase et al. [25] systematically studied sharing strategies
to balance compression and accuracy. Interest in parameter reuse dropped as models grew larger, but it has
resurged to shrink the memory footprint of LLMs. For example, Megrez2 [26] reuses experts across layers in a
standard Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, and shows a viable path forward for edge LLM deployment with
limited memory.
Perspective 2: Latent Reasoning and Iterative Refinement.
Here, the LoopLM’s iteration is viewed
as latent reasoning where each step is a non-verbal “thought” that refines the model’s internal representation.
Empirically, increasing the number of recurrent steps improves performance on complex reaasoning tasks [7, 17].
Some models make this process explicit by feeding hidden states back into the input. Coconut inserts a
“continuous thought” token, which is derived from the previous steps’s last-layer hidden state, so the model
can “ponder” in a continuous latent space [27]. CoTFormer interleaves activations back into the input before
reapplying this augmented sequence to the shared layers [28]. These explicit feedback loops contrast with
implicit LoopLM variants, where the entire thought process is contained within the evolution of hidden states
from previous recurrent step to current. Thus, both Perspective 1 (model compression) and Perspective 2
(latent reasoning) leverage shared-parameter iteration to improve parameter efficiency, and are being explored
for enhance reasoning and efficient sequence-length expansion (e.g., PHD-Transformer [29]).

Learning Adaptive Latent Reasoning with LoopLM
In this section, we formally define the LoopLM architecture on causal Transformers and present our training
scheme for adaptive latent reasoning. Figure 3 illustrates the architecture in training and inference. Our goal
is to let the model choose the number of recurrent steps per token and per example, spending less compute on
easy inputs and more on hard inputs, without sacrificing accuracy when many steps are available.
3.1
LoopLM Architecture
Let emb(·) : R|V | →Rd be the token embedding; Tθ(·) : RM×d →RM×d a causal transformer layer
parameterized by θ with hidden size d and input length M, and lmhead(·) : Rd →R|V | be the unembedding
layer with vocabulary size V . A non-looped LM stacks L layers, where ◦denotes function composition:
F(·) := lmhead ◦ML ◦emb(·),
ML(·) := TθL ◦· · · ◦Tθ1(·)
Let t ∈{1, . . . , Tmax} be the number of loop steps (the number of recurrent steps or recurrent depth). The
looped model F (t) reuses the same depth-L layer stack t times:
F (t)(·) = lmhead ◦ML ◦ML ◦· · · ◦ML
|
{z
}
t iterations
◦emb(·).
(1)
Thus, t = 1 yields the non-looped model F (1) ≡F. As shown in Figure 3 (Left), at each recurrent step t, the
model produces a language modeling head output. We define the standard cross-entropy loss at single step t
as the loss, L(t):
L(t) = Ex1:M


, x1:ℓdenotes the length−ℓprefix of the input (tokens 1 through
ell), and h(t)
ℓ
is the hidden state after t loops at position ℓ. Note that this is the individual loss for a single
recurrent step. The total training objective, which combines all steps, is defined in the following sections.
Prior literature [7, 11] has shown that scaling up t is beneficial for reasoning tasks. However, this increases
computation, and not all tokens require many steps [30, 31]. Thus, it is crucial to spend the computation
budget on the right tokens. This is achieved by the gating mechanism described in the next section.
3.2
Adaptive Computation via Gating Mechanism
To enable adaptive computation, we add an exit gate that runs in parallel with the LM head at each step
t ≤Tmax (Figure 3). At each loop t, the gate outputs an instantaneous (per-step) exit probability

where h(t) is the final-layer hidden state at step t and ϕ are the gate parameters. We define
St(x) =

 1 −λj(x)

,
S0(x) ≡1,
as the survival, or the probability of not exiting in the first t steps. The unnormalized probability of exiting
first at step t is then
˜pt(x) = λt(x) St−1(x),
t = 1, . . . , Tmax −1.
To obtain a valid discrete distribution over exit steps, we assign the remaining mass to the final step:
5
pϕ(t | x) =
(
˜pt(x),
t = 1, . . . , Tmax −1,
STmax−1(x),
t = Tmax,
so that

pϕ(t | x) = 1.
(3)
Inference with Early Exit.
As illustrated in Figure 3 (Right), we infer an exit step from the learned exit
distribution {pϕ(t | x)}Tmax
t=1 , enabling efficient inference. The cumulative exit probability up to step n is:
CDF(n | x) =
n
X
t=1
pϕ(t | x) = 1 −
n
Y
j=1
 1 −λj(x)

,
n < Tmax,
CDF(Tmax | x) = 1.
Given a threshold q ∈[0, 1], we terminate at the first step where the cumulative probability crosses q:
texit(x) = min{ m ∈{1, . . . , Tmax} : CDF(m | x) ≥q }.
The threshold q controls the compute–accuracy tradeoff: smaller q favors earlier exits (less compute), while
larger q allows deeper computation. In practice, q may be chosen globally, calibrated per task, or scheduled
with a floor/ceiling on steps. This deterministic, quantile-based policy avoids sampling while remaining
consistent with the learned distribution.
The gating parameters ϕ (and thus pϕ via {λt}) are learned in two stages:
• Stage I: During pre-training, the gates are learned jointly with the LM by optimizing an entropy-
regularized objective (Section 3.3).
• Stage II: We freeze the LM and fine-tune ϕ to sharpen pϕ (i.e., adjust depth allocation) without changing
token-level predictions.
The complete training objective is described in the next section.
3.3
Stage I: Learning an Entropy-Regularized Objective
Under naive gradient descent on the next-token prediction loss, deeper loops typically reduce the single-step
loss L(t) from Equation (2) up to some depth; beyond that, gains diminish and the gradients shift probability
mass toward later steps. As pϕ concentrates on late steps, those steps receive more training signal and their
losses drop further, which in turn pulls even more mass to the end. This self-reinforcement collapses pϕ onto
t = Tmax. An entropy term penalizes collapse to the deepest step, maintaining enough spread in pϕ to reflect
input difficulty.
Given the single-step loss L(t) and the exit-step distribution pϕ(t | x) from Equation (3), our training objective
combines next-token prediction with entropy regularization:
L =

,
H(pϕ(· | x)) = −
Tmax
X
t=1
pϕ(t | x) log pϕ(t | x).
(4)
Intuitively, the expected task loss weights each L(t) by the probability of exiting at step t. The coefficient β
controls the exploration–exploitation trade-off: larger β encourages higher-entropy (more exploratory) pϕ,
while smaller β lets pϕ(t | x) place most of its mass on a specific step when the model is confident about the
optimal depth.
6
Alternative perspective: variational inference with a uniform prior.
The objective in Equation (4)
can be viewed as an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss where the exit step z ∈{1, . . . , Tmax} is a latent
variable whose variational posterior is the learned exit distribution pϕ(z=t | x) and whose prior is π(t). The
negative ELBO is:
LELBO =
Tmax
X
t=1
pϕ(t | x) L(t) + β KL
 pϕ(· | x) ∥π(·)

.
With a uniform prior πt = 1/Tmax, the KL becomes
KL
 pϕ(· | x) ∥π

= −H(pϕ(· | x)) + log Tmax,
so minimizing the ELBO is equivalent (up to the constant log Tmax) to the objective in Equation (4). This
identifies the entropy term as a KL regularizer and clarifies that the expected loss marginalizes over exit steps,
while also linking to adaptive-computation methods such as PonderNet [32], which also optimize an ELBO for
dynamic halting.
Why a uniform prior?
Different priors encode different depth preferences. A geometric prior, as in
Ref. [32], or Poisson-lognormal priors softly favor earlier halting [17], while a uniform prior is depth-unbiased.
We adopt the uniform prior to decouple exit decisions driven by input difficulty from any global compute
preference; the entropy term then prevents collapse to always using Tmax. Empirical comparisons with
geometric priors are provided in Appendix Section A.
3.4
Stage II: Focused Adaptive Gate Training
In this stage, we freeze the LM parameters and train only the exit gate to make termination decisions based
on realized performance gains. We use a greedy signal that balances marginal improvement from an extra
loop against additional compute.
To ensure the gate does not alter LM representations, we compute a detached per-step loss L(t)
i,stop at each
token i and define the loss improvement from step t−1 to t as
I(t)
i
= max
 0, L(t−1)
i,stop −L(t)
i,stop)
(5)
where larger I(t)
i
indicates ongoing improvement; a smaller value indicates that gains have stalled and LoopLM
should opt for an early exit. We implement this by computing the ideal continuation probability, a training
label that indicates whether to continue (near 1) or exit (near 0):
w(t)
i
= σ(k · (I(t)
i
−γ))
with slope k = 50.0 and threshold γ = 0.005, so that w(t)
i
≈1 recommends continuing and w(t)
i
≈0 recommends
exiting the loop. The adaptive exit loss at step t takes the binary cross-entropy between the gate’s predicted
continuation probability 1 −λ(t)
i
and the ideal label w(t)
i , averaged over the sequence length M:

Significance of our adaptive loss.
The adaptive loss in Equation (6) trains the gate at step t to match
its predictions to the ideal behavior derived from actual performance improvements:
• Predicted probabilities: The gate generates λ(t)
i
(exit probability) and 1 −λ(t)
i
(continuation probability)
• Target labels: The ideal behavior is encoded as w(t)
i
(target continuation probability) and 1 −w(t)
i
(target exit probability)
This formulation penalizes two failure modes simultaneously:
• Underthinking: the gate exits when it should continue (large label w(t)
i , but large predicted exit λ(t)
i )
• Overthinking: the gate continues when it should exit (small label w(t)
i , but small predicted exit 1 −λ(t)
i )
Optimizing Equation (6) trains the gate to choose a greedy exit step that trades additional compute for
measured improvement. For empirical evaluations, see Section 5.4.1.

Transformer Architecture
The Ouro models use a standard decoder-only Transformer [33], prioritizing a clean implementation of the
looped computation mechanism without extraneous modifications. The core architecture consists of a stack of
Transformer blocks applied recurrently. Each block uses Multi-Head Attention (MHA) with Rotary Position
Embeddings (RoPE) [34]. The feed-forward network (FFN) in each block utilizes a SwiGLU activation [35]. To
enhance training stability, which is especially critical for deep recurrent computation, we employ a sandwich
normalization structure, placing an RMSNorm layer before both the attention and FFN sub-layers [17]. Both
models use a 49,152-token vocabulary from the SmolLM2 model [36]. This tokenizer is optimized for code
and Latin-alphabet language. Architectural details are summarized in Table 2.
Table 2 Ouro model architecture configurations. Both models share the same vocabulary and core component types,
differing in parameter count and layer depth.

Data
Data sets the capability bounds of foundation models. Our corpus spans web text, mathematics, code, and
long-context documents across multiple stages, building core language understanding while strengthening
reasoning, coding, and long-context skills. Beyond standard web crawls, we include targeted datasets for
mathematical reasoning and code generation to improve complex problem solving. Table 3 summarizes
composition and scale at each training stage.

To ensure reproducibility, our training corpus is composed entirely of open-source datasets, with data statistics
summarized in Table 4. We partition the data into four stages, each with construction strategies aligned to
the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler [37] commonly used in modern pre-training.
9
Stage 1: Pre-training
This stage supports the warmup and stable phases of training. The corpus is
primarily composed of Web CommonCrawl (CC) data. Because we sought to train the model on >2T tokens,
many popular open corpora are too small (e.g., Fineweb-Edu at 1.3T tokens [38], DCLM at 2.6T tokens [39]).
We therefore use Nemotron-CC [40] (6.3T tokens) as the main dataset for the stable-phase. To provide the
model with basic Chinese proficiency, we include Ultra-FineWeb-zh [41] and MAP-CC [42]. However, without
Chinese vocabulary in the tokenizer, characters would be fragmented into multiple byte-level sub-tokens, so
we removed Chinese from Stage 2 onwards. To enhance coding and mathematical abilities, we incorporate
OpenCoder [43] and MegaMath [44]. See Table 4 for dataset proportions in further detail.
Stage 2: Continual Training (CT) Annealing
The CT annealing stage incorporates higher-quality
data to enhance the model under the annealing learning rate. Token sequence length is extended to 16K
tokens, exceeding the length of most samples to minimize truncation. We construct the corpus from the
high-quality subset of Nemotron-CC and augment with HQ MegaMath, Nemotron-CC-Math-v1 [45, 46],
OpenCoder-Annealing [43], Nemotron-pre-training-Code-v1 [46], and Nemotron-pre-training-SFT-v1 [46].

Stage 3: Long Context Training (LongCT)
The LongCT stage extends the long-context capabilities of
the model. We adopt the 64K-length subset of ProLong [47], consisting of 20B tokens, to train the model on
longer sequences and improve its ability to handle long contexts.
Stage 4: Mid-training
This stage uses a diverse set of extremely high-quality data, consisting of both
⟨Question, Answer⟩and ⟨Question, CoT, Answer⟩samples, to further develop advanced abilities. We integrate
20+ open-source SFT datasets to boost data breadth, with thorough decontamination to avoid overlap with
mainstream evaluation benchmarks. All samples are converted to ChatML to reduce alignment tax in the
subsequent post-training stage. After processing, we obtain 182B tokens, from which we randomly sample
90B tokens. To stabilize the training distribution, we replay 30B tokens from Stage 1 and 180B from Stage 2,
yielding an effective volume of 300B tokens. Consequently, this stage consolidates and extends capabilities
acquired during pre-training under diverse supervised signals.
4.3
Training Stability and Adaptive Configuration
We use the flame [48] framework for pre-training, built on torchtitan [49]. During training, we prioritized
stability over aggressive scaling, making several key adjustments based on empirical observations of training
dynamics. These decisions were critical for achieving stable convergence with recurrent architectures, which
exhibit different optimization characteristics compared to standard transformers.
Recurrent Step Reduction for Stability.
Our initial experiments with 8 recurrent steps in Stage 1a
(Stable Training I) led to loss spikes and gradient oscillations. We hypothesize this stems from compounded
gradient flow through multiple recurrent iterations, which can amplify small perturbations. Consequently,
we reduced the recurrent steps from 8 to 4 in Stage 1b (Stable Training II in Figure 4), which balanced
computational depth with training stability.
10
Batch Size Scaling.
To further enhance stability, we progressively increased the batch size from 4M to
8M tokens. Larger batch sizes provide more stable gradient estimates, which is particularly important for
recurrent architectures where gradient flow through multiple iterations can introduce additional variance.
KL Divergence Coefficient Reduction.
We strategically reduced β in Equation (4) from 0.1 in Stage
1a to 0.05 in later stages. This reduction serves dual purposes: (1) it decreases the conflicting gradients
between task loss and the KL penalty, leading to more stable optimization, and (2) it reduces the “pull” from
the uniform prior, allowing the model greater freedom to explore beneficial depth patterns without being
artificially constrained. This adjustment allowed the model to learn useful depth patterns without undue
constraint.
Optimization Configuration.
Throughout all stages, we use AdamW optimizer with weight decay set to
0.1, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and gradient clipping at 1.0. These conservative settings were chosen specifically to
maintain stability with recurrent architectures.
Learning Rate Considerations.
We empirically found that recurrent architectures require smaller learning
rates than parameter-matched Transformers. Given compute constraints, we did not run exhaustive LR
sweeps, but instead, adopted conservative rates that prioritized stable convergence over potentially faster but
riskier schedules.
Sequence Length Progression.
The sequence length is progressively increased across stages: 4K tokens
for both pre-training phases, 16K for CT annealing, 64K for long-context training, and 32K for mid-training.
This progression stabilizes optimization while expanding context capacity with training throughput.
4.3.1
Stage-wise Training Details
• Stage 1a: Pre-training Phase I (Exploration). We initialize training with 8 recurrent steps. The learning
rate follows a Warmup-Stable schedule with a peak of 3 × 10−4. The sequence length is 4K tokens with an
initial batch size of 4M tokens, gradually increased to 8M for stability. During this phase, we observed
training instabilities that prompted subsequent architectural adjustments.
• Stage 1b: Pre-training Phase II with Stability-Driven Upcycling. After identifying stability issues in Stage 1a,
we reduced the recurrent steps from 8 to 4. To maintain computational efficiency while improving stability,
we split our approach into two variants:
– 1.4B Ouro: Uses the original 24 pre-trained layers with 4 recurrent steps
– 2.6B Ouro: Upcycles 24 layers to 48 via layer duplication with 4 recurrent steps
The recurrent nature of our architecture makes this upcycling process particularly smooth, as the shared
weights across iterations naturally facilitates layer duplication without the typical instabilities seen in
standard transformer upcycling.
• Stage 2: CT Annealing. The learning rate is annealed to 3 × 10−5 while exposing the model to high-quality
training data. The recurrent steps remain at 4, having proven optimal for the stability-performance trade-off.
The data composition is carefully balanced as shown in Table 5.
• Stage 3: LongCT. The batch size is held at 8M tokens. The reduced KL coefficient (β = 0.05) continues to
provide stable training dynamics even with the 64K-length sequences.
• Stage 4: Mid-training. The learning rate is further reduced to 1 × 10−5 with a cosine scheduler to help the
model better absorb on this diverse, high-quality dataset.
4.4
Supervised Fine-Tuning
Data Composition.
We perform SFT on a diverse corpus of approximately 8.3M examples drawn from
high-quality public datasets. As shown in Table 6, our training mixture emphasizes mathematical reasoning
11
(3.5M examples) and code generation (3.2M examples), while also incorporating scientific reasoning (808K
examples) and conversational abilities (767K examples).
For mathematical reasoning, we combine OpenThoughts3 [50] and AceReason-1.1-SFT [51] to provide
comprehensive coverage of problem-solving strategies. Our code training data aggregates multiple sources
including AceReason-1.1-SFT, OpenCodeReasoning [52], Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset [53], and
OpenThoughts3, ensuring broad exposure to diverse programming paradigms and reasoning patterns. Scientific
reasoning capabilities are developed through OpenThoughts3 and Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset,
while conversational proficiency is enhanced using the OO1-Chat-747K1 and DeepWriting-20K [54] datasets.
Training Configuration.
We train for 2 epochs with a maximum sequence length of 32K tokens using
the LlamaFactory codebase [55]. We employ the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2 × 10−5 and
β = (0.9, 0.95), applying a cosine decay schedule for stable convergence.2

Reinforcement Learning Attempts
Following the SFT stage, we conducted exploratory RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)
alignment experiments using DAPO [56] and GRPO [57] on the DAPO-17K dataset. These attempts did
not yield significant performance gains over the final SFT checkpoint. The primary issue stemmed from the
model’s dynamic early-exit mechanism. vLLM/SGLang provide fast rollouts via a fixed execution path, which
breaks under LoopLM’s variable-depth computation.
We tried two approaches, neither successful:
1. Off-policy rollouts: We generate full four-step rollouts in vLLM, yielding four logit candidates per token.
We then selected the first token to exceed the termination threshold to simulate an early exit. For
updates, we used the cumulative loss up to that step, discarding later tokens and losses. This off-policy
mismatch, i.e., where tokens are produced with the final depth, and losses computed at an earlier depth,
did not improve performance.
2. Fixed 4-Round RL: To avoid off-policy issues, we performed rollouts and updates at a fixed four recurrent
steps. Training progressed normally but performance did not surpass the SFT checkpoint. A like cause
is scale: after having already undergone extensive SFT, these smaller models may have limited headroom
for RL gains. Interestingly, the model still used fewer rounds at inference when beneficial despite being
trained at four rounds. The mechanism behind this generalization remains unclear.
We will further explore RL alignment for this architecture as we continue to develop infrastructure that can
fully support LoopLM’s dynamic computation.

2Training was interrupted due to infrastructure issues; we resumed from the last saved checkpoint with a learning rate close to
the original cosine decay schedule.

Summary of Evaluation Results
Based on the overall evaluation results, we highlight key conclusions
about our base models:
(1) Our 1.4B parameter Ouro model (with 4 recurrent steps) achieves performance comparable to the 4B
Qwen3-Base across most benchmarks. Notably, it matches or exceeds the 4B model on challenging
reasoning tasks such as BBH (71.02 vs 70.95), GSM8K (78.92 vs 72.86) and MATH500 (82.40 vs 59.60)
(2) The 2.6B parameter Ouro model outperforms dense models up to 8B parameters on reasoning-intensive
benchmarks. It achieves 55.73 on MMLU-Pro, 80.46 on BBH and 90.85 on MATH500, surpassing the
8B Qwen3-Base (53.72, 77.65 and 62.30 respectively).
(3) The recurrent architecture shows particular strength on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and
knowledge manipulation, with the most pronounced gains observed on MMLU-Pro, BBH, GSM8K
and MATH500 benchmarks, validating our hypothesis that iterative computation enhances reasoning
capabilities.

We analyze the Ouro model’s performance as a function of its recurrent computational depth. Our models
were trained with a maximum of 4 recurrent steps (T = 4). We investigate this behavior for both our base
models and our SFT Ouro-Thinking models.
Base Model Performance.
Tables 10 and 11 present the performance of the Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B base
models, respectively, evaluated at depths from T = 1 to T = 8.
For both base models, performance on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, ARC-C) generally improves
up to the trained depth of T = 4.
Steps T = 5 through T = 8 represent extrapolation beyond the
training configuration. As shown in both tables, benchmark performance sees a moderate degradation when
extrapolating, with a noticeable drop compared to the peak at T = 4.
However, this degradation in task-specific performance contrasts sharply with the model’s safety alignment.
As detailed in Section 7.1, the model’s safety improves as the number of recurrent steps increases, even into the
extrapolated regime (T > 4). This suggests that while the model’s fine-grained knowledge for benchmarks may
falter beyond its training depth, the iterative refinement process continues to enhance its safety alignment.
Reasoning Model (SFT) Performance.
We conduct a similar analysis on our SFT models, Ouro-Thinking,
to see how recurrent depth affects specialized reasoning tasks. Results for the 1.4B and 2.6B models are
presented in Table 12 and Table 13, respectively.
We conduct a similar analysis on our SFT models, Ouro-Thinking, to see how recurrent depth affects specialized
reasoning tasks. Results for the 1.4B and 2.6B models are presented in Table 12 and Table 13, respectively.
For both SFT models, performance at T = 1 is very low, confirming that iterative refinement is essential for
these complex tasks. Performance generally peaks at or near the trained depth, but shows slightly different
patterns. The 1.4B model (Table 12) peaks around T = 4 or T = 5. The 2.6B model (Table 13) tends to peak
slightly earlier, at T = 3 or T = 4. Interestingly, neither model peaks strictly at T = 4 across all tasks, unlike
the base model evaluations which are often logit-based. This may suggest that the longer decoding required
for these reasoning tasks allows for a more active exploration of capabilities at different recurrent depths.
For both models, performance degrades as they extrapolate to deeper, unseen recurrent steps (T = 6 −8),
reinforcing that performance is optimized for the depth seen during training.
5.4
Early Exit and Adaptive Computation Efficiency
A defining advantage of the LoopLM architecture lies in its capacity for adaptive computation allocation.
Unlike standard transformers with fixed computational budgets, our model can dynamically adjust the number
16
of recurrent steps based on input complexity. This section investigates various strategies for implementing
adaptive early exit, comparing their effectiveness in balancing computational efficiency with task performance.
5.4.1
Early Exit Strategies
We explore three distinct approaches to determining when the model should terminate its iterative computation
and produce the final output.
Baseline: Static Exit.
The simplest strategy forces the model to exit at a predetermined recurrent step,
regardless of the input characteristics. While this approach provides predictable computational costs, it fails
to leverage the model’s potential for adaptive resource allocation. We evaluate static exit at steps 1 through 4
to establish performance bounds and understand the relationship between computational depth and accuracy.
Hidden State Difference Threshold.
This heuristic-based approach monitors the magnitude of represen-
tational changes between consecutive recurrent steps. At each step t, we compute ∆ht = ∥ht −ht−1∥2 and
trigger early exit when ∆ht < ϵ for some threshold ϵ.

We evaluate four approaches across different average exit
rounds: static baseline (red triangle), hidden state difference
threshold (green squares), Ponder gate from standard pre-
training (blue circles), and Ponder gate with specialized
adaptive exit training from Section 3.4 (orange diamonds).
Learned Gating with Q-Exit Criterion.
Our
primary approach employs the learned exit gate
described in Section 4, which produces step-wise
halting probabilities λt based on the model’s cur-
rent hidden states.
During inference, we apply
the Q-exit criterion: at each step t, we compute
the cumulative distribution function CDF(t) =
Pt
i=1 p(i|x) and exit when CDF(t) exceeds the
threshold q ∈[0, 1].
The threshold q serves as
a deployment-time hyperparameter that controls
the compute-accuracy trade-off without requiring
model retraining.
We evaluate this strategy under two training con-
figurations. The untrained configuration uses the
gate as trained during our standard pre-training
pipeline with the entropy-regularized objective (uni-
form prior KL loss). This represents the gate’s be-
havior when jointly optimized with language mod-
eling throughout Stages 1-4. The trained configu-
ration additionally applies the specialized adaptive
exit loss described in Section 3.4, which explic-
itly teaches the gate to base stopping decisions on
observed task loss improvements.
Experimental Results.
Figure 5 presents the accuracy-efficiency trade-off curves for all strategies on
the MMLU benchmark. By varying the exit threshold (or static exit step for baseline), we obtain multiple
operating points for each method, enabling direct comparison at equivalent computational budgets measured
by average exit round.
Several key findings emerge from this analysis:
1. The Ponder gate with specialized adaptive exit training achieves the best accuracy at every computational
budget, demonstrating that the loss improvement-based training signal described in Section 3.4 provides
clear benefits over standard entropy regularization. At an average exit round of 2.5, the specialized
training reaches 66% accuracy while the standard gate achieves approximately 64%;
17
2. Even without specialized training, the Ponder gate from standard pre-training substantially outperforms
the static baseline, validating that the entropy-regularized objective with uniform prior successfully
enables adaptive computation. The gate learns to differentiate input difficulty through the general
training dynamics, though it lacks the explicit supervision to correlate stopping decisions with actual
performance improvements. This demonstrates that our base training approach already captures useful
signals for resource allocation;
3. The hidden state difference threshold strategy performs surprisingly competitively, closely tracking both
gate configurations. At moderate computational budgets (2-3 average rounds), it achieves accuracy within
1%-2% of the specialized trained gate, suggesting that representation stability provides a reasonable
proxy for computational convergence. However, the consistently superior performance of the specialized
trained gate across all operating points confirms that explicit supervision via the adaptive exit loss
captures information beyond what can be inferred from representational dynamics alone.
4. Comparing the untrained and trained gate configurations reveals the value proposition of the specialized
training procedure. The gap between these curves, approximately 2%-3% accuracy at most operating
points, represents the benefit of teaching the gate to explicitly monitor task loss improvements I(n)
t
rather than relying solely on entropy regularization to discover stopping policies. This empirical result
validates our design choice to introduce the adaptive exit loss as a specialized training objective.
5. The baseline’s monotonic improvement from 1 to 4 rounds confirms the “deeper is better” property
while revealing diminishing returns. The dramatic jump from 1.0 to 2 rounds (40% to 60% accuracy)
contrasts with the marginal gain from 3 to 4 rounds (67.35% accuracy). This pattern explains why
adaptive methods prove effective: most examples achieve near-maximal performance at intermediate
depths, with only a minority requiring full computational depth.
5.4.2
KV Cache Sharing for Inference Efficiency
The recurrent nature of our architecture introduces a challenge: naively, each recurrent step requires maintaining
its own KV cache, leading to 4× memory overhead for our 4-step model. We investigate strategies to reduce
this overhead through KV cache reuse.
Prefilling Phase
During the prefilling phase (processing the input prompt), we find that all four recurrent
steps require their own KV caches, as each step transforms the representations in ways that cannot be
approximated by earlier steps.
Attempting to reuse KV caches during prefilling leads to performance
degradation (>10 points on GSM8K).
Decoding Phase
However, during the decoding phase (auto-regressive generation), we discover that KV
cache reuse becomes viable. We explore two strategies:
1. Last-step reuse: Only maintain KV cache from the final (4th) recurrent step
2. First-step reuse: Only maintain KV cache from the first (1st) recurrent step.
3. Averaged reuse: Maintain an averaged KV cache across all four steps
Table 14
KV cache sharing strategies during decoding. Both last-step and averaged strategies achieve minimal
performance loss while reducing memory by 4×.

As shown in Table 14, these strategies yield dramatically different outcomes. Reusing only the first step’s
cache results in a catastrophic performance collapse (e.g., 18.73 on GSM8K, down from 78.92), indicating that
18
the initial representations are insufficient for subsequent decoding steps. In contrast, both the last-step and
averaged reuse strategies achieve nearly identical performance (within 0.3 points on GSM8K) to the full cache
baseline, while successfully reducing memory requirements by 4×. The last-step strategy performs slightly
better than the averaged approach on MATH-500, suggesting that the final recurrent step’s representations
are most informative for subsequent token generation. This finding enables practical deployment of LoopLM
models with memory footprints comparable to standard transformers of similar parameter count.

Understanding LoopLMs Superiority from a Parametric Knowledge Viewpoint
Why LoopLMs achieve far better performance when the parameter counts do not increase?
Although
potential enhanced reasoning capabilities were observed in [7], the source of the advantage remains unclear.
Specifically, do LoopLMs perform better due to the models’ increased knowledge capacity with the same size
of parameters? Or do they have a better capability in extracting and composing the knowledge encoded within
the parameters? Toward understanding the improvement of the phenomenon, we explore what capabilities are
exactly enhanced by simply looping more times. In this section, we perform experiments to test the model’s
abilities to memorize factual knowledge in its parameters, and the capabilities of manipulating and composing
existing knowledge encoded in the parameters based on a set of fully controllable synthetic tasks in [67–69].
6.1
LoopLMs does not increase knowledge capacity
We first explore the knowledge capacity, i.e. the model’s storage capacity of facts in the parameters. We aim
to answer the first question: do LoopLMs achieve better performance by memorizing knowledge when the
parameter count is not increased?
Settings. Following the Capo task setting in Physics of language models [67, 68], we construct synthetic
biographies to test how much information the model memorizes. Specifically, we generate several synthetic
biographic datasets bioS(N) with different number of people N, and train a series of language models to
memorize the information contained in the dataset. Each biography contains the individual’s name and five
attributes a1, a2, ..., a5 of the person: gender, birth date, university, major, and employer. The names n
and the attributes ai are randomly selected from a pre-defined set N and Ai and combined together as a
biography using a random template. Based on the random generation process, we have an information-theoretic
lower bound for the model in the minimum bits required to encode all the names and attributes. To check
whether the models memorize the biographic information accurately, we look at the probability of predicting
the ground-truth attributes with the trained models given the biography context. Calculating the sum of
cross-entropy loss on each attribute token positions, we can estimate how much information (estimated in
bits) has already been memorized in the trained language model, which is our knowledge capacity metric.
With this metric, we can compare the knowledge capacity between the original model (with only one recurrent
step) and the looped model (with 4 recurrent steps) with the same parameter count to investigate whether
looping increases knowledge capacity. Moreover, as larger models should encode more information than smaller
models, we also aim to investigate whether looped models have a better scaling effect when the size of the
model grows. We thereby trained GPT-2 style models of different parameter numbers ranging from 1M to
40M (with depth and hidden dimension varied) and measured the number of bits of knowledge learned by
each model. We trained on bioS(N) with N ranging from 20K to 500K individuals for 1000 exposures. More
training details are provided in Section B.1.
Results. The results are visualized in the plot “bits vs. # of parameters”, where we can observe the comparison
between iso-parameter looped and non-looped models. Our results are shown in Figure 6 (Left): looping does
not increase knowledge capacity nor improve capacity scaling. Models with and without loops all attain
around a similar capacity ratio ≈2 bits/parameter. Therefore, the number of parameters itself can be seen as
a direct indicator of knowledge capacity, and merely increasing looping does not help enhance knowledge
capacity itself.

models. They also achieve better or comparable performance comparing to the iso-flop baseline (12 ⊗1) model.
6.2
LoopLMs prevails in knowledge manipulation
We have already shown that reusing parameters cannot help the model memorize more atomic factual knowledge.
However, natural language is not only about single-hop factual knowledge. In most of the scenarios, predicting
the next token requires combining different piece of knowledge, which we called knowledge manipulation [67].
Does looping and reusing parameters help LoopLMs in tasks that require flexible usage of knowledge? We
further consider two synthetic tasks to investigate the hypothesis on knowledge manipulation capacity: the
synthetic Mano task in [68] based on modular arithmetic, and a multi-hop QA task in natural language [69]
composing individual facts.
Mano Task. We first explore the knowledge manipulation task Mano in [68], based on a complex tree structure
with restricted modular arithmetic knowledge. Models need to solve the task without intermediate thinking
process. As illustration, an example could be <bos> + * a b c <eos> requires the model to directly output
(a ∗b) + c mod 23. To solve this task, the model needs to (1) apply the arithmetic rules modulo 23 as the
factual knowledge encoded in the parameters, and (2) parse the binary tree structure of the arithmetic to
compose all calculations.
To evaluate the manipulation capability thoroughly, we consider the test accuracy across different difficulty
levels based on maximum expression length L, which accounts for the number of operations in the sample. The
model is trained with online samples with all possible expression lengths ℓ∈[1, L] and tested on the maximum
expression length L. We prepare three levels of difficulties L = [10, 16, 24] to test LoopLM’s superiority over
non-looped models given fixed training budget. We train ({2, 3, 6, 12} ⊗1) standard transformers as the
baselines and several looped models (k ⊗12/k) with k = 2, 3, 6. More details are included in Appendix B.2.
Results. The results in Figure 6 show that given the same parameters, looped models always outperform their
non-looped counterpart for all possible k ∈{2, 3, 6}. Even with the same number of FLOPs in the model, the
looped models can often perform better. This indicates that LoopLM has a better inductive bias towards
knowledge manipulation: with the same budget on training samples and computation, LoopLM can achieve
comparable or even better performance after training when the task requires manipulation capability (e.g.,
parsing the arithmetic tree) given limited amount of required knowledge (e.g., modular arithmetic rules).
Multi-hop QA. Next, we corroborate our conjecture with a natural language multi-hop reasoning task proposed
in [69], based on synthetic facts on relations R between |E| different individuals, like The instructor of A is
B and The teacher of B is C. The target is to answer multi-hop questions like ‘Who is the teacher of the
instructor of A?’. We aim to study whether looping enables the original transformer better learn to perform

Figure 7 We trained LoopLMs and standard transformer baselines with the same parameters on Multi-hop QA tasks.
To investigate the sample efficiency of LoopLMs, we vary the number of unique training samples (from 2.5%
to 25% all possible QA pairs) for models with different loops. We compare the final performance using the same
compute budget in total training tokens. Left. As shown, models with more loops requires fewer samples to learn
the 3-hop QA task. Right. As an example, we train with 15% of all possible QA pairs (12000 unique samples) for
20000 steps with context length 1024 and batch size 2048. Models with more loops learn faster and achieve better
performance comparing with models without loops.
internal multi-hop reasoning in a natural language setting. Compared to the Mano task, the task requires the
model to memorize more factual knowledge with layer-wise data structure, which is closer to practical natural
language multi-hop reasoning.
Multi-hop QA tasks require huge amount of samples to learn according to [69] when training standard
transformers.
To study whether LoopLMs accelerate the learning process of this multi-hop knowledge
manipulation task, we consider sample efficiency in learning. Specifically, we study how many different QA
pairs are necessary for the trained model to achieve 100% accuracy, as well as the performance after training
on a fixed budget of unique training samples. For simplicity, we focus on the task with 3-hop QA pairs. We
separate all possible QA pairs into training subsets of different sizes, and compare when each model perfectly
generalizes on the leave-out test set. Similarly to the Mano task, we train a standard (6 ⊗1) transformer as
the baseline, and compare it with looped models (6 ⊗{2, 4}) to study the effect of the universal transformer.
We also train an iso-flop model (24 ⊗1) for comparison. More details are included in Appendix B.3.
Results. The results in Figure 7 show that looped models generally learn the multi-hop QA task with fewer
examples compared to both the non-looped iso-parameter model when the training budget is the same.
Moreover, LoopLMs learn the multi-hop task much faster than the non-looped model with the same number
of unique QA samples. The improved sample efficiency on the multi-hop reasoning task further demonstrates
that LoopLM has a better ability to learn to compose and manipulate atomic factual knowledge.
Based on the results in both Mano and multi-hop QAs, we can conclude that LoopLMs have a better inductive
bias towards more flexible manipulation of learned knowledge, instead of increasing the knowledge capacity.
The conclusion holds for both synthetic tasks regardless of whether the task is more reasoning-heavy (Mano)
or knowledge-heavy (Multi-hop QA). This also corresponds to the analysis (see Appendix B.4) on the existing
benchmarks (e.g. MMLU): adding more recurrent steps significantly improves the performance on more
reasoning-heavy categories, while the improvements on more knowledge-heavy tasks is limited.
6.3
Discussion: towards understanding why LoopLM helps knowledge manipulation
Why does LoopLM naturally bias towards better manipulation of the knowledge encoded in the parameter
space? We conjecture that the reason lies in the inherent recurrent structure of LoopLM. Given that the
knowledge capacity is limited by the parameter counts, looping enables LoopLM to better utilize the knowledge
encoded in the parameters. LoopLM can reuse the knowledge in each looped block, retrieve new necessary
factual information, or apply structured procedures to obtain the final prediction.
Search on the parametric knowledge graph. During pre-training, language models often obtain an enormous
21
amount of factual knowledge and learn analysis procedures with a rather shallow thinking depth. To perform
more challenging tasks, the model needs to use multiple pieces of knowledge in the parameter space, which
requires the model to search in-depth in the knowledge graph with directional dependencies formed by the
atomic facts or knowledge. LoopLM naturally support an efficient reuse of the knowledge and algorithms
stored in the parameter spaces: even though the knowledge piece is not retrieved or used in the previous
calculations, the recurrent structure enables LoopLM to redo the procedure and extract necessary information.
Based on the abstraction above, we try to understand why LoopLMs are able to search on knowledge graph
without adding more parameters. Specifically, we study the expressivity of LoopLM on a synthetic task.
We consider the extensively studied search problem in the literature of latent reasoning [27, 70, 71]: graph
reachability on a knowledge graph. Here, we consider that only part of the knowledge graph Gctx is included
in the context, and most of the knowledge relations G must be encoded in the parameters. The model must
learn to compose the context knowledge Gctx and the learned knowledge G. Compared to traditional CoT
and recent proposed latent CoT [27, 70], we show that LoopLM is a parallelizable latent reasoning paradigm
that requires fewer sequential reasoning steps.
Theorem 1 (Informal). Fix n as the maximum size of the combined knowledge graph G. Given the adjacency
matrix of the context graph Gctx and a query pair (s, t), there exists a one-layer transformer independent of
Gctx with loops O(log2 D) times that checks whether there exists a path from s to t in the combined knowledge
graph (G + Gctx), where D is the diameter of (G + Gctx).

The proof and the discussion on LoopLM’s efficiency are deferred to Appendix B.5. We claim that the
universal transformers maximize the parallelism in exploring all-pair connectivity and reduce the sequential
computation steps exponentially from O(n2) to O(log D), making the latent reasoning much more efficient
than the traditional CoT view of looping [7] and continuous CoT [70]. The potential efficient latent reasoning
ability may account for the superiority of LoopLM in knowledge manipulation, which also may contribute to
the superior performance in reasoning-heavy tasks.
Recurrence improves sample efficiency. The expressiveness result of LoopLM does not explain why the
transformers with loops often learns knowledge manipulation tasks with samples much fewer than its iso-FLOP
counterpart. We conjecture that the reason lies again in the recurrent structure of LoopLM. Assuming the
reasoning tasks require multiple manipulation and recursion using learned parametric knowledge or algorithmic
procedure, the models have to learn a repeated structure across layers of different depth. For deep transformer
models without looping, they potentially have to explore a large function class where each block of parameters
are not tied. The parameter-sharing layers may help the model explore a much smaller realizable hypothesis
class, thus reducing the sample complexity of learning those manipulation tasks. It could be a possible
statistical reason that LoopLM enjoys a better sample complexity on those reasoning/manipulation tasks.

Safety, Faithfulness and Consistency
7.1
Safety
We assess model safety using HEx-PHI dataset [20], which contains 330 examples covering 11 prohibited
categories. HEx-PHI employs GPT-4o as a judge to assign each model response a harmfulness score from 1 to
5; a higher score indicates a less safe output. Additionally, we compute the harmfulness rate, defined as the
proportion of the test cases that receive the highest harmfulness score of 5. For Ouro Base models, we use
greedy decoding with max_new_tokens=128; For Ouro Thinking models, we sample with temperature=1.0,
top_p=0.7 with max_new_tokens=8192. We evaluate Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models with recurrent steps
ranging from 1 to 8, and report the result in Figure 8a. Notably, while our models were trained with only 4
recurrent steps, both models show their extrapolation capability by extending recurrence steps to 5-8 during
inference. This demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize to deeper computation than seen during training.
The Ouro Thinking checkpoints further enhance safety alignment, reducing harmful rates to 0.009 for Ouro

(b) PCA analysis on Ouro 1.4B
Figure 8 (a) For both 1.4B and 2.6B models, Ouro demonstrates improved safety alignment on HEx-PHI as the
recurrent steps increase. Note that models were trained with 4 recurrent steps; evaluations at steps 5-8 demonstrate
successful extrapolation beyond the training configuration. (b) As the recurrent steps increase, Ouro 1.4B can
better distinguish the benign prompts and harmful prompts, leading to safer responses. We perform PCA on
the hidden representation of the last input token from the model’s top layer. Harmful prompts with a harmfulness
score of 4 or 5 at recurrent step 1 are marked with ×, while other harmful prompts are shown as circles. The color of
each point reflects the harmfulness score of the corresponding response. Benign prompts are shown as green squares.
1.4B Thinking and 0.003 for Ouro 2.6B Thinking at 4 recurrent steps, comparable to Qwen3-4B-Thinking
(0.009).
To further investigate how increasing recurrent steps affects the model’s safety alignment, we conduct Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on the hidden representation of the last input token from the top model layer.
For a controlled analysis, we select 100 benign and 100 harmful questions with identical formats (all the
examples are the questions starting with “How to”) from Zheng et al.(2024) [72]3. Additionally, we evaluate
the model’s responses to the 100 harmful questions and compute a 5-level harmfulness score (same as the one
used in HEx-PHI) for each response. We plot our PCA analysis on Ouro 1.4B in Figure 8b, from which we
have the following observations. First, as the number of recurrent steps increases, the model becomes more
capable of separating benign and harmful prompts, resulting in safer responses, as indicated by the decreasing
number of red points. Furthermore, most points associated with unsafe responses appear near the middle
of the plot, which represents the boundary between the “benign” and “harmful” clusters. This suggests that
difficulty in distinguishing harmfulness may lead to unsafe responses, which can be alleviated by increasing
the number of recurrent steps.
7.2
Faithfulness
We call a model’s thinking process faithful if it is (i) procedurally correct and (ii) causally coupled to the final
answer. Concretely, a faithful process should satisfy a counterfactual criterion: if the justification is intervened
on (e.g., altered to a different intermediate state), the final prediction should change accordingly. A growing

Figure 9 Left. ROCAUC of linear probes by layer on Quora Question Pairs. Each colored curve shows a probe
trained on hidden states within a given 2 to 8 recurrent steps to predict that loop’s answer; Qwen3-4B models are the
baselines. Vertical dotted lines mark loop boundaries. In recurrent step i = 2, 3, 4, the ROC AUC rises quickly within
a recurrent step, then partially resets at the next loop, indicating that intra-step answers are determined early while
cross-step updates modify the provisional answer. Right. Agreement across recurrent steps. Heat map (A) over

body of work [73–76] shows that standard LLMs often appear to decide on an answer before generating
chain-of-thought text and then use that text to rationalize the already-formed decision.
In LoopLM, the reasoning substrate is the sequence of latent states h(1) →h(2) →· · ·→h(T ). Each transition
h(k) →h(k+1) performs non-trivial computation using the same shared-weight block, and each step is trained
to improve the task objective. Thus, the causal path to the answer is this latent trajectory, not any optional
natural-language trace. When we decode intermediate text Text(Rk) from h(k) via the LM head, we treat it
as an instrumented readout of the internal state rather than the mechanism itself. Because h(k) is directly
supervised by the LM loss, its projection into token space provides a faithful snapshot of what the model
currently represents.
Standard evaluation of faithfulness is often based on the manipulation of the reasoning process, CoT, and
check if the average treatment effect of CoT is significant. In our case, we cannot manipulate the latent
reasoning process. Instead, we adopt an observational proxy for mediation: we read out intermediate hidden
representations and test whether predictions change as recurrence deepens on inputs that admit multiple
plausible labels. Concretely, we assess whether intermediate “thinking” genuinely mediates decisions by
measuring step-by-step predictability and agreement patterns. We use the Quora Question Pairs dataset [77],
which asks whether two short questions are semantically equivalent: a setting with ambiguity and weakly-
defined decision boundaries. There are a lot of ambiguous questions in this dataset:
Example: Ambiguous questions in Quora dataset
Question: does the following two questions have the same intent?
Pair 1:
1. What are the questions should not ask on Quora?
2. Which question should I ask on Quora?
Answer: False
Pair 2:
1. How do we prepare for Union Public Service Commission?
2. How do I prepare for civil service?
Answer: True
If a thinking process merely rationalizes the pre-committed answer, even if the questions are very ambiguous,
the answers will not change after the reasoning process. This has been reported for Gemma-2 9B and
reproduced by us on Qwen-3-4B-Thinking. As shown in the left part of Figure 9, the simple linear probe on
the final-token logits on the Qwen3-4B-Thinking model shows 0.99 ROC AUC predicting the model’s eventual
24
answer, which means the thinking process almost does not affect the results.
In our model, the situation is very different. our 1.4B×4 model uses 24 layers per recurrent step. We train
linear probes on hidden states from layers 1 through 24i to predict the step-i answer, for i∈{2, 3, 4}. Within
a single recurrent step, the step-i answer is well predicted by a probe on representation within layer 24i,
indicating strong intra-step alignment between state and decision, which is similar to the non-reasoning model
Qwen-4B-Instruct, showing in left part of Figure 9. Crucially, probes on the preceding representation (layer
24(i−1)) do not reliably predict the step-i decision for i ∈{2, 3, 4}, showing that the new recurrent pass
performs additional computation that can revise a provisional choice.
To further examine the consistency between the results of different rounds. We also compute a step-by-step
agreement matrix A over 1,000 Quora Question Pairs, where A[i, j] counts identical labels between step i
and step j (diagonal = 1000 by construction). See the right side of Figure 9. Adjacent steps never reach
full agreement; for example, A[2, 4]=361 indicates only 36.1% of step-2 answers match step-4. A[2, 3]=551
indicates only 55.1% of step-2 answers match step-3. We also notice that when i ≥4, the overlap consistency
between step-i and step-i + 1, A[i, i + 1], is close to 1000. We think this phenomenon comes from: (1) the
model does not learn to reason recursively when i > 4. The model is trained within 4 loops; (2) as the number
of loops increases, the answer gradually converges to a fixed point.
All in all, this systematic disagreement across steps when i ≤4 is precisely what a faithful latent process
should exhibit: the model is updating its decision as recurrence deepens, and intermediate predictions are not
frozen rationalizations of the final output.
7.3
More Discussion
The practical barrier for safety-critical deployment is that a model’s articulated reasoning and its final answer
may diverge. The LoopLM architecture reduces this gap by exposing a sequence of intermediate predictors
that are strongly aligned with the final predictor and can be used both for acceleration and for pre-emptive
control. We summarize three deployment advantages.
Built-in draft model for speculative decoding.
Let Text(Rt) denote the language-model head attached
to the latent state after recurrent step t, and let T be the maximum step used at deployment. The pair
 Text(Rs)

{z
}

, Text(RT )

,
1 ≤s < T.
forms a native proposal–verification decomposition for speculative decoding without training an external draft
model. Proposals are sampled from Text(Rs) and verified under Text(RT ) using standard acceptance tests;
rejected tokens are rolled back as usual. Because both heads share the same parameters up to step s, cached
activations and KV states can be reused, reducing verifier overhead. This turns the recurrent structure into
an architectural primitive for draft–verify decoding rather than an add-on.
Joint acceleration and pre-emptive safety.
Using the same proposal–verification split, safety checks
can be interleaved with speculative decoding without extra models. At step s:
1. Generate draft tokens with Text(Rt) and compute their acceptance under Text(RT ).
2. Run safety screening on the draft distribution or sampled drafts before any token is surfaced to the user.
Screening can operate on logits, beams, or short candidate spans.
3. If a violation is detected, halt or reroute the response before streaming; otherwise, accept tokens that pass
both verification and safety checks.
Because Text(Rs) and Text(RT ) share the latent trajectory, intermediate predictions are well-aligned with
the final answer distribution. This alignment makes the step-s output a reliable proxy for the step-T output
for the purpose of early screening, while the verifier maintains final quality. The Q-exit threshold q further
provides a single deployment knob that simultaneously adjusts compute, consistency, and safety strictness by
shifting the average exit depth.

Anytime generation with monotone refinement.
The training objective in Section 3.4 optimizes the
expected task loss across steps while preserving the deeper-is-better property. Consequently, for next-token
prediction loss,

so each additional loop refines the distribution toward higher-quality predictions. This yields an anytime
algorithm: decoding may begin from any intermediate step s and continue streaming while later steps continue
to verify or revise. Unlike chain-of-thought pipelines, which often require completing a reasoning prefix before
emitting answers, LoopLM exposes a single predictive interface at every step, enabling immediate fallback to
a smaller compute budget when latency constraints apply.

Conclusion
In this work, we introduced Ouro, a family of Looped Language Models that demonstrate exceptional
parameter efficiency by integrating iterative computation and adaptive depth directly into pre-training on
7.7T tokens. Our 1.4B and 2.6B models consistently match or exceed the performance of 4B and 8B standard
transformers, showcasing a 2-3× efficiency gain. We demonstrated this advantage stems not from increased
knowledge storage, but from a fundamentally superior capability for knowledge manipulation, supported
by synthetic experiments and theoretical analysis. We also presented a practical training objective using
entropy regularization with a uniform prior to learn adaptive depth, and validated efficient KV cache sharing
strategies that make LoopLMs viable for real-world deployment.
Beyond performance, the LoopLM architecture exhibits unique properties: its iterative refinement process
provides a causally faithful reasoning trace, mitigating the post-hoc rationalization issues seen in standard
CoT, and its safety alignment uniquely improves with increased recurrent steps, even when extrapolating.
This work establishes iterative latent computation as a critical third scaling axis beyond parameters and data.
Future research should focus on enhancing performance extrapolation at greater depths and exploring more
complex recurrent mechanisms, solidifying this parameter-efficient approach as a necessary direction in a
data-constrained era.

Figure 10 Effect of the prior over exit steps. Left: training loss (300-step sliding average) for a LoopLM with
Tmax = 4 under different priors on z. Colored curves correspond to geometric priors with parameter η ∈{0.1, . . . , 0.9};
the red curve uses a uniform prior. Shaded regions indicate variability across runs. Right: prior probability over
LoopLM steps induced by each η (uniform shown in red). Stronger geometric bias (larger η) concentrates mass on
shallow steps, reducing credit assignment to deeper computation.
Experimental setup.
Unless otherwise noted, we keep the model, data, optimizer, and schedule identical
across conditions and only change the prior π used in the KL term of the loss. All results are obtained
on a 776M-parameter LoopLM with Tmax = 4 recurrent steps. Training is performed on the FineWeb-Edu
corpus [38] for a total of 20B tokens with a global batch of 50K tokens per optimization step, i.e., roughly
40K steps in total.4 For geometric priors we sweep λ ∈{0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9}; the uniform prior assigns equal
mass to all steps. To assess variability, we repeat each condition with multiple random seeds; shaded areas in
Figure 10 denote the variability across runs. All other hyperparameters follow our training recipe, keeping β
fixed across prior choices.
Convergence and final loss.
As shown on the left of Figure 10, the uniform prior consistently achieves
lower training loss and cleaner convergence on the 776M LoopLM. Geometric priors plateau higher, with
the gap widening as λ grows (i.e., stronger bias toward early exit), reflecting weaker supervision for deeper
iterations.
Stability and exploration.
Geometric priors exhibit larger late-training oscillations, consistent with
premature collapse of qϕ(z | x) onto shallow steps and reduced entropy. The uniform prior imposes no
structural depth preference, so the KL term behaves as pure entropy regularization: exploration is maintained
longer, and the model can allocate probability mass across multiple depths until it has learned which examples
benefit from deeper computation.
Depth utilization.
The right panel of Figure 10 visualizes the priors. Large-λ geometric priors concentrate
mass at t=1, 2, neglecting deeper steps (t≥3) of credit assignment; this undermines the “deeper is better”
property. With a uniform prior, all depths receive comparable signal, enabling later iterations to specialize
and deliver higher accuracy when maximum depth is allowed at inference.
Compute–accuracy trade-off.
Although the uniform prior does not explicitly favor early exit, it does not
preclude efficient inference: at test time we can still cap steps or apply a halting threshold. For a fixed average

step budget, models trained with a uniform prior achieve a strictly better accuracy-compute Pareto frontier
than those trained with geometric priors, indicating that unbiased depth exploration during pre-training turns
into better deployment trade-offs.
B
Physics of LoopLMs
In this appendix, we conclude all the experimental settings and details in Section 6. Section B.1 includes the
experiments on knowledge capacity; section B.2 includes the settings on knowledge manipulation synthetic
tasks. Section B.3 introduces the detailed setting on the synthetic QA task following [69]. Finally, Section B.5
provides the theoretical results, detailed proof, and the discussion with the current theoretical results.
B.1
Capo: knowledge capacity
In this section, we introduce the knowledge capacity proposed in [67, 68]. The task evaluates models’ efficiency
in memorizing factual knowledge within its parameters, which is measured by bits per parameter. We tested
different sizes of models and visualize the knowledge scaling law through plotting bits v.s. parameter number.
Dataset: Synthetic Biographies
We synthesize fake biographies following the bioS(N) dataset in [67].
Specifically, we generate N biographies of a random generated person together with their date of birth, city of
birth, university, major, and employer. In our work, we online sample the individual attributes and generate
the biographies in natural language using a random selected fixed template. An illustrative example is:
Layla Jack Beasley celebrates their birthday on January 24, 1914. They spent formative years in Portland,
ME. They focused on Business Analytics. They supported operations for Delta Air Lines Inc. in Atlanta,
GA. They received their education at Pepperdine University.
Model
We use original GPT2 architecture and replace the positional encoding with RoPE [34]. In the Capo
task, we tie the LM head and the embedding layer. To test the capability of universal transformer, we also
added looping module s.t. the transformer blocks can be looped several times. We explore a broad range
of model sizes varying in hidden dimension and depth. The notation a-b-lc represents the model with 64a
hidden dimensions (a attention heads with each head 64 dimensions), b layers, and c LoopLM steps (loops).
The context length is set to 512.
Training details
We use AdamW optimizer by setting (β1, β2) = (0.9, 0.98), ϵ = 10−6 with 1000 steps of
warmup followed by a cosine learning rate schedule from 1 to 0.1× of the original learning rate. We use bf16
training and packing is used during training. We masked different pieces of biographies from each other in
each concatenated chunk.
We pass each data piece for 1000 times (similar to the 1000-exposure in [67]) during training. Since the final
performance is not sensitive to learning rate choices, we consider learning rate η = 0.001, wd = 0.02, and total
batch size 192. We pick N ∈{20K, 50K, 100K, 200K, 500K}.
Evaluation: Knowledge Capacity Ratio
After pre-training on the bioS(N) dataset, we assess a model’s
knowledge capacity, defined as the number of bits of information it can reliably store. To make this measure
comparable across models of different sizes, the raw bit count is normalized by the number of model parameters,
yielding a “bits per parameter” metric. The derivation and motivation of the metric in discussed in [67]. For
readers, we refer the detailed setting to Section 2.1 of [67].
Definition 1. Given a model F with P parameters trained over the bioS(N) dataset Z, suppose it gives
p1 = lossname(Z) and p2 = lossvalue(Z), which are the sum of cross entropy loss on the name tokens and
attribute tokens, respectively. The capacity ratio and the maximum achievable capacity ratio are defined as
R(F)
def
=
N log2
N0
ep1 + N log2 S0 ep2
P
,
Rmax(F)
def
=
N log2 N0 · N + N log2 S0
P
,
for N0 = 400 × 400 × 1000, S0 = 2 × (12 · 28 · 200) × 200 × 300 × 100 × 263 as all possible configurations.
35
Ignoring names, each person encodes approximately log2(S0) ≈47.6 bits of knowledge. The evaluation
accounts for partial correctness. For instance, if a model recalls the year of a person’s birth but not the exact
date, the partially correct information still contributes to the overall bit-level computation. This approach
allows for a fine-grained measurement of knowledge retention, rather than relying on a strict all-or-nothing
scoring.

Mano: knowledge manipulation
We followed [68] and used the Mano task to investigate the models’ capability of manipulating stored knowledge
within the parameters without intermediate thoughts.
Dataset The dataset consists of modular arithmetic instances with tree structures of ℓoperations, where the
number of operations ℓ≤L as the maximum length. ℓis uniformly sampled from [1, L]. The expressions are
presented in prefix notation. For example, a length-3 instance is:
<bos> <len_3> - * a b + c d <ans> ans
which corresponds to (a ∗b) + (c −d) mod 23. All the operations are on F23. The task only involves (+, −, ∗).
The only tokens we use are the operations, numbers from 0 to 22, and the special <bos>, <ans> and length
tokens len_{i} with i ∈[0, L].
Training details
We use AdamW optimizer with (β1, β2) = (0.9, 0.98), ϵ = 10−6 and gradient clipping with
maximum norm 1.0. We employ 1000 steps of warmup followed by a cosine learning rate schedule to minimal
learning rate 0.1 of the peak learning rate. We use bf16 training with packing and set the context length
to 1024 tokens. Different pieces of mano problems are masked from each other in each concatenated chunk
during training.
We conduct hyperparameter search over learning rates lr ∈{0.00005, 0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005} with weight decay
0.1 and global batch size 128. We experiment with model depths L ∈{10, 16, 24} layers and hidden dimension
1024. Training is performed for {80K, 110K, 200K} steps respectively for different difficulties. We run all
experiments across 3 random seeds and report the best performance.
Evaluation
During evaluation, we only use the expressions with the hardest length ℓ= L. Accuracy is
computed separately due to the masks. We consider exact match accuracy since the final answer is single-token.
B.3
Multi-hop question answering on synthetic relations
We followed [69] to construct the natural language multi-hop QA task. Comparing with Mano, the QA task is
more knowledge-heavy and with a slightly simpler structure. [69] found that the model needs exponential
many k-hop data for traditional transformer to learn. We chose this task to investigate if recursive structure
in the reused-parameters can improve the sample efficiency of the task, showing better manipulation capability
of LoopLM.
Dataset
The dataset contains |E| entities—each with a unique name—and N relation types. We created 500
distinct single-token person names (e.g., Jennifer) and 20 single-token relation names (e.g., instructor) to serve
as namespaces for entities and relations. We reused the name list in [69]. The complete list of relation names
and a partial list of entity names appear in Tables 5 and 6 in [69]. The multi-hop questions are generated
through a K = 5 hierarchical layers, where each layer has 100 individuals. Each entity is connected to |R|
randomly chosen person in the next layer. This structure naturally generates |E|/5 × |R|k k-hop questions. In
our setting, since we only consider 3-hop questions, the number should be 8 × 105.
For training, we use part of all the 3-hop training set and test on the leave-out 3000 test questions. For each
test instance, we greedy decode the single token answer given the question prompt (e.g. ‘Who is the instructor
of the teacher of Bob? \n Answer:’). We evaluate the exact match accuracy.

performance comparing with models without loops.

Figure 12 Left & Right. We further train with 100000 and 120000 unique QA pairs for 20000 steps with context length
1024 and batch size 2048. We train the baseline with 24 layers, which is equivalent flops with the loop 4 transformers.
Similar to the main text, models with more loops learn faster and achieve better performance comparing with models
without loops, even with iso-flop transformers. The loop 2 average performance is weaker than the iso-flop version
transformer since it has less equivalent depth when N = 105, but it surpasses the baseline with more data provided.
Training details
We use AdamW optimizer with (β1, β2) = (0.9, 0.98), ϵ = 10−6 and gradient clipping 1.0.
We run 1000 steps of linear warmup followed by a cosine learning rate schedule to minimal learning rate 0.1
of the peak learning rate. We use bf16 training with packing with context length 1024 tokens. QA pairs from
distinct samples are masked from each other during training.
We use a base model architecture with 1024 hidden dimensions, 16 attention heads, and 6 layers. We allow it
to loop in {1, 2, 4} times. Following the experimental setup in [69], we set the learning rate to 0.0005 with
1000 warmup steps and train for a total of 20,000 steps using batch size 2048. We run all experiments across
4 random seeds and report the average performance.
B.3.1
Additional experimental results
As the supplement of the main text, we present additional experiments to show that the superiority of LoopLM
is general across different number of unique samples. For presentation, we only consider the interval of
{105, 1.2 × 105, 1.4 × 105} to exhibit the difference between looped models and non-looped baselines. We also
checked iso-flop baseline models with the same hidden dimension and 24 layers5. The results are presented
below in Figure 11 and Figure 12.
5We note that in Figure 12, the iso-flop baseline with N = 1.2 × 105 does not perform significantly better than the shallower
version in the main paper. We conjecture that it could be because of the randomness, or insufficient hyperparameter tuning. We
believe further follow-up experiments should be necessary to further validate this conclusion here in the appendix.

Case study: improvements across different categories in MMLU
To validate our findings from synthetic tasks on a broad, real-world benchmark, we conducted a granular
analysis of performance gains across all 57 sub-categories of MMLU. Our hypothesis is that if LoopLMs
primarily enhance knowledge manipulation and reasoning, the largest performance gains should appear in
procedural, reasoning-heavy tasks, while knowledge-heavy, retrieval-based subjects should see less improvement.
We measured the relative improvement by comparing the accuracy at the single recurrent step (Loop 1)
against the accuracy at our fully trained depth (Loop 4). The detailed results for all 57 categories are
available in Table 15. The analysis strongly supports our hypothesis. The categories with the most significant
improvements are those requiring logical, maths, or procedural reasoning; conversely, categories that depend
more on retrieving specific, memorized facts or nuanced world knowledge showed the most modest gains.
Example: Categories with the most significant/modest improvements
With most significant improvements:
• Elementary Mathematics: +155.6%
• Formal Logic: +143.3%
• Logical Fallacies: +127.8%
• High School Statistics: +126.9%
With most modest improvements:
• Moral Scenarios: +7.8%
• Global Facts: +8.3%
• Virology: +13.7%
• Anatomy: +21.4%
This stark contrast indicates that the iterative computation is not simply increasing the model’s accessible
knowledge (as seen in the nearly flat ‘global_facts‘ improvement) but is actively performing the multi-
step symbolic manipulation required for complex subjects like logic and math. This real-world benchmark
result corroborates our synthetic findings in Section 6.2, confirming that the LoopLM architecture’s primary
advantage lies in enhancing knowledge manipulation, not raw storage.
B.5
Theory: latent thought with LoopLM
In this section, we prove that LoopLM can solve the graph reachability problem (with part of the graph
knowledge learned in the parameters) in O(log n) steps. The results are closely related to the expressivity
power of transformers and looped transformers with padding [11, 12, 78, 79]. It matches the expressiveness
lower bound results in [78, 79], and also resembles the state tracking tasks [80, 81] which requires O(log n)
depths. We first define the task rigorously and state our main theorem. We finally discuss the theoretical
improvement, caveats of the results, and all related theoretical results.
We first define our task based on the intuition of knowledge manipulation. Challenging knowledge manipulation
tasks often have multiple steps or hierarchical structures, which requires the model to search in the knowledge
graph with directional dependencies formed by the atomic facts or knowledge. Moreover, the context also
contains conditions or new facts necessary for the problem. Therefore, we consider the searching task that
requires the model to both encode the fixed hidden knowledge graph G in the parameters and utilize the
contextual information (additional graph) Gctx. The goal is to check if two queried nodes are connected. The
formal definition is as follows (modified from [70]):
Definition 2 (Graph reachability on knowledge graph). Let V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is the set of vertices
and E = {e1, e2, . . . , em} is the set of edges. Let G = (V, E) be a directed hidden knowledge graph, and
Gctx = (V, Ectx) be an input additional knowledge graph. Given a source node s a target node t, the task is to
output 1 when there exists a path from s to t on the combined graph G + Gctx := (V, E + Ectx), and output 0
when s cannot reach t on the combined graph.
Transformer architecture
In this setting, we consider a simple single-head transformer architecture. We
only use one-head and a two-layer gated MLP layer. For clearer theoretical demonstration, we use a special
normalization layer LN() to threshold on ˆH: LN( ˆH)i,j = 1{ ˆHi,j > 0}. And the overall architecture for each
loop is (where Q, K, V, W1, W2 are all shared through layers)
ˆHi+0.5 = LN( ˆHi + AttnQ,K,V ( ˆHi)), AttnQ,K,V ( ˆHi) = V Hisoftmax( ˆH⊤
i K⊤Q ˆHi)

Input Format
We define the adjacency matrix of the graph G as A = [a1, a2, ..., an] ∈Rn×n. Similarly, we
define Actx = [a1,ctx, a2,ctx, ..., an,ctx]. We use one-hot embeddings vi to denote the vertex embedding. We
consider the following input sequence format with length n + 1 for this task (assuming we already have the
embeddings):
H0 =
 v1
v2
· · ·
vn
a1,ctx
a2,ctx
· · ·

∈R2n×n
where the first n tokens are the input context graph adjacency matrix. We assume the LoopLM recurrent for
L steps, and we denote the hidden state sequence for the i-th recurrence:
Hi =

.
For simplicity, we ignore the encoding and decoding process and have a direct output protocol: the final
output for query (s, t) is the t-th entry of a(L)
s
.
Now we state the main theorem given the previous setting.
Theorem 2 (LoopLM solves reachability in log D steps). Fix n as the maximum size of the combined
knowledge graph G. Taking the adjacency matrix of the context graph Gctx ∈Rn×n fed in as a n-token
sequence and given a query pair (s, t), there exists a one-layer, single-head transformer independent of Gctx,
with recurrent O(log2 D) times and a hidden dimension of de = 2n that can check whether there exists a path
from s to t in the combined knowledge graph (G + Gctx), where D is the diameter of (G + Gctx).
We directly construct the attention and the MLP layer for the LoopLM to implement an algorithm that is
similar to Warshall’s algorithm, using Boolean matrix powers with repeated squaring. The proof idea is to do
a parallel search on all pairs connectivity, doubling the reachable distance with each loop. Since the maximum
distance (i.e. diameter) is D, we only need O(log D) rounds to decide whether two nodes are connected or
not. The attention enables each loop to iterative square the current adjacency matrix, and the MLP stores
the hidden encoded graph G’s adjacency matrix to help internal knowledge manipulation.
Proof. We assign the parameters Q, K, V, W1, W2 as follows (β →+∞is a large scalar):
K = β

which only contains the input context graph’s adjacency matrix. We assume the LoopLM loops for L steps,
and we denote the hidden state sequence for the i-th loop:

For simplicity, we directly output the t-th entry of a(L)
s
for query (s, t). The model should check whether (s, t)
are connected, i.e. (a(L)
s
)t = 1 or 0. We are going to prove by induction that for each recursion, a(i)
j
contains
all the vertices vk (i.e. (a(i)
j )k = 1) that vertex vj is connected to, and the distance between vj and v are less
than or equal to 2i−1. Therefore, we only need log D + 1 loops to get the final answer.
Base. When i = 1, the constructed parameters ensure that the j-th node vj attend to all the nodes that are
directly connected to vj with the same attention score β. This guarantees that the attention layer will average
40
the nodes’ tokens that vj is connected to. The j-th column of the attention before the thresholding layer
becomes (|aj,ctx| means the nodes that vj connects to)

This updated adjacency vector naturally contains all nodes that has distance ≤2 to vj in context graph Gctx
after the thresholding layer. It naturally includes nodes with distance 1.
Now we consider the output of the MLP layer, which only adds the adjacency matrix of hidden knowledge
graph G to the residual stream.

which combines the adjacency matrices of the context graph Gctx and the hidden knowledge graph G. After
the thresholding in the end, all non-zero entries become 1, which already includes all distance 1 nodes for all
nodes. Therefore, we have that a(1)
j,ctx contains all reachable nodes within distance 1 of node vj after the first
recursion.
Induction. Assume at the recursion step i (i ≥1), all a(i)
j
contains all reachable vertices within distance 2i−1
of vj. Now the hidden state sequence is going through loop i + 1. To finish the proof, we show that a(i+1)
j
contains all reachable vertices within distance 2i of vj.
The attention for this stage looks at a(i+1)
j
now, and the j-th node vj uniformly attend to all the nodes that
are connected to vj within distance 2i−1. The j-th column of the attention before the thresholding layer

which also contains all vertices connected to vj with distance 2i. That means (a(i+1)

whether (s, t) is connected within 2i distance. By induction, we finish the proof and with L = ⌈log2 D⌉+ 1
recursion steps, the model can correctly solve reachability on the combined graph G + Gctx.
Discussion on related theoretical results We provided a modified construction from [11], which requires n3
padding tokens that increase the computation complexity to O(n6). However, our construction requires
O(n) hidden dimension as the continuous CoT did in [70]. The Θ(n) requirement is necessary because the
superposition in latent space needs to (in the worst case) encode Θ(n) nodes’ information, which can be
a theoretical limitation. The requirement can be relaxed when there is an upper bound for the maximum
number of vertices that some vertex is connected to.
Input format In our construction, the input format is the adjacency matrix of the graph. As a natural
alternative, [70] used a sequence with length O(n2) as the input to encode all the different edges. To make
LoopLM also work on this setting, some additional induction head mechanism (similar to [70]) is needed to
extract all edges and combine them into the adjacency matrix. With slight modification, we can still get the
solution with sequential steps O(log D).

Scaling Law for LoopLMs
To further explore the potential of LoopLM, we conduct a series of small-scale experiments to investigate
the scalability and predictability inherent in LoopLM. Specifically, our work focuses on the following three
research questions:
• RQ1: What is the performance gap between standard models and LoopLM?
• RQ2: How do recurrent steps impact the total loss and step-wise loss in the context of LoopLM?
• RQ3: What is the inherent connection between total loss and step-wise loss?
D.1
RQ1: What is the performance gap between standard models and LoopLM?
To understand the performance gap between standard models and LoopLM, we quantify this difference in
terms of benchmark performance. We also observe how this gap varies with changes in recurrent step and
model size to guide the further scaling and iteration of LoopLM.
42
Experimental Setup
We prepare five model sizes: 53M, 134M, 374M, 778M, and 1.36B. For recurrent steps,
we prepare four different depths: 1, 2, 4, and 8. It is worth noting that for standard models, different recurrent
steps effectively multiply the number of layers in the model. We evaluate the performance on the following
benchmarks: ARC-Challenge [92], ARC-Easy [92], HellaSwag [86], LAMBADA [93], OpenBookQA [94], and
PIQA [95]. In all sub-experiments, we train on 20B tokens using the FineWeb-Edu corpus [38]. We present
the benchmark performance from the final step. For LoopLM, the recurrent step used for evaluating is the
maximum recurrent step.
By observing the trends in the curves, we derive the following observations:
1. Whether standard models or LoopLM, the model’s performance improves with increasing model size and
recurrent step. As shown in Figure 13, for all recurrent steps, the benchmark performance of both the LoopLM
and Standard models increases as the model size grows, which aligns with the principle of LLMs: larger is
better. As shown in Figure 14, except for the LoopLM at 778M and 1.364B, both the LoopLM and Standard
models show that benchmark performance increases as the recurrent step increases. This indicates that latent
reasoning is indeed useful for both the LoopLM and Standard Transformer.

Figure 13 The average benchmark performance of LoopLM and Standard Transformer models under different recurrent
steps as model size varies. With a recurrent step of 1 (top left), both models have identical architectures, resulting in
overlapping curves. Overall, as the model size increases, the benchmark performance improves. The average benchmark
score demonstrates the average results of the six benchmarks.
2. Overall, the performance of the standard model exceeds that of LoopLM under the same conditions. This
gap increases with the recurrent step and decreases with the model size. Observing Figure 13 and Figure 14,
it is clear that the benchmark performance of the Standard model is consistently higher than that of LoopLM,
indicating that the Standard model has a scoring advantage without considering computational budget.

Figure 14 The average benchmark performance of LoopLM and Standard Transformer models under different model
sizes as recurrent step varies. Except for the LoopLM at the model size of 778M and 1.364B, in all other cases, the
benchmark performance of the model increases with the increase in recurrent steps.
Furthermore, we define the benchmark performance gap as the benchmark performance of the Standard
model minus that of LoopLM, and this value is positive in all our experiments. As shown in Table 18, as
the recurrent step increases, the benchmark performance gap also increases, suggesting that as the number
of recurrences rises, the effect of models not sharing parameters gradually surpasses that of models sharing
parameters. Besides, we find that the benchmark performance gap generally has a negative correlation with
model size when the maximum recurrent step is relatively low, meaning that as the model size increases, the
performance of LoopLM becomes closer to that of the Standard model, resulting in a smaller gap between the
two. This trend is particularly consistent when the recurrent step is 4.

varies at different model sizes. The gap is defined as (Standard model score - LoopLM score). As the recurrent step
increases, the performance gap generally increases.

RQ2: How do recurrent step impact the total loss and step-wise loss in the context
of LoopLM?
In this subsection, we investigate the predictability and generalizability of LoopLM from the perspective
of training loss, examining the impact of recurrent step on the trends in total loss and step-wise loss. The
experiment is set up in complete consistency with Section D.1, but we focus more on the total loss and
step-wise loss during the training process. Here, step-wise loss refers to the loss of the same LoopLM at
different recurrent step.
Here, we have following variables: model size N, training data size D, maximum recurrent step Tm, recurrent
step T, total loss Lt, and step-wise loss Ls. Following Chinchilla [96], we first attempt to fit the relationship
between Lt and N, D, Tm in the form of a power law:
Lt = E +
A
(N + t1)α +
B
(D + t2)β +
C
(Tm + t3)γ
The purpose of t1, t2, and t3 is to prevent the variables from exploding in value near zero, allowing the
fitting curve to be smoother. We refer to above formula as the Total Loss Scaling Law. First, to validate the
44
predictability of LoopLM, we fit all the data points, and the resulting curve is shown in Figure 15. We find
that the actual loss curve and the predicted loss curve are highly consistent, demonstrating the predictability
of LoopLM in terms of model size, training data size, and max recurrent step. We quantify the consistency of
the scaling law using the coefficient of determination R2. An absolute value of the R2 closer to 1 indicates a
better fit, with positive values representing a positive correlation and negative values representing a negative
correlation. Fitting the Total Loss Scaling Law using all data points and calculating R2 with all data points,
we obtain an R2 value of 0.9596. This confirms the strong correlation between total loss and model size,
training data size, and max recurrent step, demonstrating the predictability of the Total Loss Scaling Law.

Figure 15 Illustration of the actual loss curve and the loss curve predicted by the scaling law. To demonstrate the
predictability of LoopLM, we have used all data points for fitting, proving its predictability in terms of model size,
training data size, and max recurrent step. The orange dashed line represents the prediction, while the blue solid line
represents the actual loss.
In addition to its predictability, we further explore the generalizability of the Total Loss Scaling Law.
Predictability refers to the ability of the Scaling Law to fit all data points into a unified curve when all data
points are available. Generalizability, on the other hand, indicates whether the Scaling Law can predict unseen
data points when fitting is done with a subset of data points. For example, generalizability tests whether the
performance of a 14B model can be predicted using the known performances of 1B and 7B models [97]. To
verify its generalizability across model size N, training data size D, and maximum recurrent step Tm, we have
conducted related experiments, details can be found in Appendix E.1.
During the LoopLM training process, we compute the cross-entropy loss at each recurrent step, which we
refer to as step-wise loss Ls. We aim to explore the relationship between step-wise loss Ls and the current
recurrent step T, model size N, and training data size D. Similarly, we can fit the scaling law between Ls
and N, D, T, with the formula as follows:
Ls = E +
A
(N + t1)α +
B
(D + t2)β +
C
(T + t3)γ
45
We refer to the above formula as the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law. We also present the fitting effectiveness
from the perspectives of predictability and generalizability. Regarding predictability, we fit all data points.
Even with the same recurrent step, the loss curve can vary significantly across different maximum recurrent
steps. To ensure the independence of the variable recurrent step T, we do not consider the maximum recurrent
step in the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law formula and focus solely on the relationship between Ls and N, D, T.
Therefore, we have a total of three major experiments, each representing the fitting of the Step-wise Loss
Scaling Law for maximum recurrent steps of 2, 4, and 8. The fitting results of the Step-wise Loss Scaling
Law are shown in Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18, which illustrate the trends of the actual and fitted
curves for maximum recurrent steps of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. We find that in some cases in Figure 17 and
Figure 18, Ls increases with the increase in D. We consider this a special case and will discuss it in detail
in Section D.3; we will ignore these outlier data points during fitting. The R2 for the three max recurrent
steps are 0.8898, 0.8146, and 0.795, respectively. As the maximum recurrent step increases, the increase in
the number of data points leads to lower R2 values. The step-wise loss itself is less stable than the total
loss, resulting in greater variability. Thus, the obtained R2 values are not as high as those of the Total Loss
Scaling Law. However, it is still evident that the scaling law is able to capture the overall trend of the curves,
demonstrating the predictability of the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law. The fitting parameter γ of the Step-wise
Loss Scaling Law is positive, indicating that Ls decreases as the recurrent step increases. This aligns with our
original intent in the design of the recurrence. Besides, we present the generalizability of the Step-wise Loss
Scaling Law in Appendix E.2.

In summary, both total loss and step-wise loss exhibit a strong correlation with N, D, T/Tm. The fitting
results demonstrate the predictability and generalizability of the Scaling Law for LoopLM. In next section, we
will explore the relationship between total loss and step-wise loss in greater depth.

the maximum recurrent step is equal to 8.

total loss consists of two components. The first part is the expected task loss, which is a weighted sum of the
step-wise loss. The second part is entropy regularization, whose primary purpose is to ensure that the learned
gating mechanism qϕ does not converge to a specific recurrent step.
In our extensive small-scale experiments, we have observed an interesting phenomenon: the exploitation of
total loss for shallow step-wise loss. To be specific, as shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18, when the model
size is insufficient, the shallow step-wise loss increases with the growing amount of training data. This is an
unusual phenomenon, typically, all step-wise losses should decrease as the amount of training data increases.
We attempt to explain this phenomenon. In Section D.2, it is mentioned that the step-wise loss decreases
with an increasing recurrent step, indicating that deeper recurrent steps result in lower Ls. To minimize the
expected task loss, the learned gating mechanism assigns more weight to deeper recurrent steps. However,
entropy regularization ensures that the learned gating mechanism does not deviate too much from the prior
distribution. When the model size is insufficient, the amount of information it can encode is limited. To
further reduce the total loss, this results in an increase in shallow step-wise loss, which in turn allows the
weights to favor higher recurrent steps to lower the total loss. Thus, to ensure that the trend of step-wise loss
remains normal, a larger model size may be more effective for LoopLM.
As mentioned in Section D.2, the scaling law for LoopLM is predictable and generalizable for both total loss
and step-wise loss. We have:
Lt = Et +
At
(N + t1t)α +
Bt
(D + t2t)β +
Ct
(Tm + t3t)γ
L(T )
s
= Es +
As
(N + t1s)α +
Bs
(D + t2s)β +
Cs
(T + t3s)γ
The subscripts s and t represent the fitting parameters for the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law and the Total Loss
Scaling Law, respectively. By substituting the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law into the training objectives, we
have:
Lt =
Tm
X
T =1


Es +
As
(N + t1s)α +
Bs
(D + t2s)β +
Cs
(T + t3s)γ

−β · H(qϕ(z | x))
For the first three terms in L(T )
s
, the sum of qϕ equals 1, allowing us to factor it out, which gives us:
Lt = Es +
As
(N + t1s)α +
Bs
(D + t2s)β +
Tm
X
T =1
qϕ(z = t | x)
Cs
(T + t3s)γ −β · H(qϕ(z | x))
As the amount of training data increases, the learned gating mechanism qϕ stabilizes, and we observe that the
value of the entropy regularization term becomes relatively low, accounting for approximately 1% to 5% of
the total loss. If the form of qϕ gradually stabilizes, we treat it as a constant term, and the formula becomes:
Lt = Es +
As
(N + t1s)α +
Bs
(D + t2s)β + Eother
In Section D.2, when considering the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law, we will fix the maximum recurrent step.
Once we determine the model’s maximum recurrent step Tm, the forms of the above formula and the Total
Loss Scaling Law are completely consistent, indicating that there is a trend consistency in the scaling law
between total loss and step-wise loss.
We further demonstrate this through practical experiments. We take the situation where the max recurrent
step is equal to 4. First, we perform a standard fitting of the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law to obtain the
fitting parameters Es, As, Bs, Cs, and so on. Next, we observe and record the distribution of qϕ for each

recurrent step Tm = 4. These weights were collected during inference on the MMLU benchmark.
recurrent step t when the maximum recurrent step Tm = 4, as shown in Figure 19. For convenience, we take
the average value of qϕ at different recurrent steps and treat it as a normal discrete distribution, resulting
in the distribution {0.0004, 0.0855, 0.3793, 0.5348}. We then substitute this distribution and the T values
into the training objective, ignoring the entropy regularization term (after the training stabilizes, it becomes
relatively low, for simplicity, we will just ignore it). This leads to a fitting formula, and upon substituting the
actual fitting data points N and D, the computed R2 value is 0.961, with the fitting results illustrated in
Figure 20. We can see that the fitting accuracy is high, and the predicted curve closely matches the actual
curve, indicating that, under a relatively rough estimate, step-wise loss can be transformed into total loss,
thus indirectly suggesting an intrinsic connection between the two.

Details of the Scaling Law for LoopLM
E.1
Generalizability for the Total Loss Scaling Law
To demonstrate the generalizability of the Total Loss Scaling Law across model size, training data, and
maximum recurrent step, we have conducted relevant experiments. Our evaluation metric is the coefficient
of determination R2. To evaluate the fitting effectiveness of the Scaling Law, we calculate the coefficient of
determination of all data points.
Model Size Generalizability For model size generalizability, our total data points include five different model
sizes: 53M, 134M, 374M, 778M, and 1.364B. We select three model sizes as fitting data points, resulting in
 5

= 10 possible combinations. After fitting, the average R2 across the 10 combinations is 0.9542, which is
similar to the result obtained with the full data points, demonstrating the model size generalizability of the
Total Loss Scaling Law. Figure 21 illustrates an example.
Training Data Generalizability Regarding the training data size, we are primarily interested in whether
the Scaling Law can predict model performance as training data increases. Therefore, we typically use the
preceding data points to predict future data points. To align with this starting point, we have conducted
three sets of experiments, using the current 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data points as fitting data to predict
the overall fitting performance.The R2 values for using the first 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data as fitting

Figure 21 Illustration of model size generalizability for the Total Loss Scaling Law. The fitting data includes model
sizes of 374M, 778M, and 1.364B. The predicted curves for the unseen model sizes of 53M and 134M closely align with
the actual curves, demonstrating the generalizability of the Total Loss Scaling Law with respect to model size.

points are 0.9385, 0.9609, and 0.962, respectively. It is evident that as the number of data points increases,
the consistency between the fitted curves and the actual curves improves. In other words, if you want to
predict model performance at larger training sizes, collecting data points closer to those of larger model sizes
will yield better prediction results.
Max Recurrent Step Generalizability We have conducted a total of three different maximum recurrent steps:
2, 4, and 8. To verify the generalizability with respect to maximum recurrent step, we select two of these
as fitting data points and perform the fitting, followed by validation on the full data points and calculation
of R2. The average R2 for the three sets of experiments is 0.9581, demonstrating the generalizability of the
Total Loss Scaling Law with respect to maximum recurrent step.
E.2
Generalizability for the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law
Following the same approach as in Section E.1, we seek to explore the performance of the Scaling Law on
unseen data points, specifically regarding the generalizability of the Scaling Law. In this subsection, we
explore the generalizability of the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law from three aspects: model size generalizability,
training data generalizability, and recurrent step generalizability. The evaluation metric remains the coefficient
of determination R2. To evaluate performance on unseen data points, we will calculate the coefficient of
determination using all data points, while fitting will only use a subset of the data points.
Model Size Generalizability The Scaling Law experiments include five different model sizes: 53M, 134M,
374M, 778M, and 1.364B. To verify the generalizability of model size, we select three of these as fitting data
points. In each fitting experiment, the Scaling Law does not have access to the remaining two model size data
points during fitting, ensuring the reasonableness and validity of the results through repeated experiments.
Specifically, to save on resources, we have conducted experiments only for max recurrent step of 2 and 4,
resulting in a total of
 5
3

× 2 = 20 small experiments. The final experimental results show that for max
recurrent step of 2, the average R2 value is 0.8815, while for max recurrent step of 4, the average R2 value is
0.797. This difference is not significant compared to the R2 values obtained from the full data points (0.8898
and 0.8146), demonstrating the generalizability of the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law with respect to model size.
To illustrate the results more clearly, we show example fitting curves in Figure 22. It is important to note
that using only a subset of data points for fitting may lead to miscalculations of the Scaling Law on unseen
data points. Due to the nature of the power law, if the values are too small, it may result in a very large
computed value, causing inaccuracies. To ensure the validity of the fitting, we can attempt to adjust the
initial fitting values or impose some constraints on the fitting algorithm. For convenience, we adjust the initial
fitting values to make the fitting formula effective over a broader range of data points.
Training Data Generalizability Following Section E.1, to ensure the validity of the fitting, we have selected
the first 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data points for fitting. In the case of max recurrent step of 2, the R2
values are 0.8686, 0.8882, and 0.8896, respectively. For max recurrent step of 4, the R2 values are 0.793,
0.813, and 0.8142. It can be observed that as the number of fitting data points increases, the fitting accuracy
improves. This aligns with the intuition that fitting with more data points generally yields better results.
Additionally, these results are similar to those obtained from fitting with the full data points (0.8898 and
0.8146), demonstrating the generalizability of the Step-wise Loss Scaling Law with respect to training data.
Recurrent Step Generalizability In the case of max recurrent step equal to 2, there are only two recurrent
step values, making it unreasonable to conduct generalizability experiments. Therefore, we choose to perform
experiments with max recurrent step equal to 4. In this situation, we have four different recurrent step
values: 1, 2, 3, and 4. We randomly select three of these as fitting data points, resulting in a total of
 4
3

= 4
experiments. The average R2 value obtained from these four experiments is 0.8118, which is similar to the R2
value of 0.8146 obtained from the full data points, demonstrating the generalizability of the Step-wise Loss
Scaling Law with respect to recurrent step. Figure 23 presents a specific example, showing a high degree of
consistency between the fitted curve and the actual curve.
